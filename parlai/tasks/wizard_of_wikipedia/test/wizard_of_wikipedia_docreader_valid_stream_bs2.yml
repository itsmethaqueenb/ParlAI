      text: 'Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of
        horticulture. In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers,

        plantings, to plants in large or small containers grown inside or outside.
        Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve
        a large number of different plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active
        participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which

        for injured animals, purportedly including an armadillo, snake, and alligator.
        One of these animals, a squirrel named Peapod, was featured in a few episodes
        of his show. He had a half-brother, Jim, whom he mentioned in passing on his
        show. Ross dropped out of high school in the 9th grade to work as a carpenter
        with his father, Jack Ross, where he lost part of his left index finger. This,
        however, did not affect the way he held his palette while painting. In 1961,
        then 18-year-old Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force and was put

      text: 'Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects.
        It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of
        the world''s most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the
        rapid growth of the postal service. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost
        perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new
        stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its
        stamps. Stamp collecting is generally accepted as one of the areas that make
        up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A philatelist
        may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term
        "philatelist" to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors
        accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about
        the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however,
        generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas
        of philatelic studies. Postage stamps are often collected for their historical
        value and geographical aspects and also for the many subjects depicted on
        them, ranging from ships, horses, and birds to kings, queens and presidents.

        and published by GT Interactive in 1996. It is the first game in the "Quake"
        series. In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like,
        medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using a wide array
        of weapons. The successor to id Software''s "Doom" series, "Quake" built upon
        the technology and gameplay of its predecessor. Unlike the "Doom" engine before
        it, the "Quake" engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and had early support
        for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After "Doom" helped popularize multiplayer
        deathmatches, "Quake" added various multiplayer options. Online multiplayer
        became increasingly common, with the QuakeWorld update and software such as
        QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet
        easier and more reliable. It features music composed by Trent Reznor and Nine
        Inch Nails. In "Quake" single-player mode, players explore and navigate to
        the exit of each Gothic and dark level, facing monsters and finding secret
        areas along the way. Usually there are switches to activate or keys to collect
        in order to open doors before the exit can be reached.
