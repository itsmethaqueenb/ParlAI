          consumption of drinks with added sugar.
        - Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated soft drinks, sports
          drinks and energy drinks.
        - The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and beverage producers
          like Coca-Cola often oppose it.
        - Advocates such as national medical associations and the World Health Organization
          (WHO) promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation, aimed to discourage
          unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs of obesity.
        - Type II Diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed and developing
          countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly due to type
          II diabetes in 2015 alone.
      - Diet drink:
        - Diet (alternatively marketed as sugar-free, zero-calorie or low-calorie)
          drinks are sugar-free, artificially sweetened versions of fizzy beverages
          with virtually no calories.
        - They are generally marketed toward health-conscious people, diabetics, athletes,
          and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness, or reduce
          their sugar intake.

          outcry among environmental and health advocates.
        - Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally and internationally,
          and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally in soft drinks.
        - The benzene forms from decarboxylation of the preservative benzoic acid
          in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron and copper)
          that act as catalysts, especially under heat and light.
        - The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation of benzoic
          acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid
          (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).
      - Container deposit legislation:
        - Container-deposit legislation (also known as a deposit-refund scheme, bottle

          of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable)
          at the point of sale.
        - When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer
          in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer
          (presumed to be the original purchaser).
        - It is a deposit-refund system.
        - 'Governments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons,
          including, for example:  Deposits that are not redeemed are often kept by
          distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling
          fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect, sort, and handle
          the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to
          fund environmental programs.'

      - New Coke:
        - New Coke was the unofficial name for the reformulation of Coca-Cola introduced
          in April 1985 by the Coca-Cola Company to replace the original formula of
          its flagship soft drink, Coca-Cola (also called Coke).
        - New Coke originally had no separate name of its own but was simply known
          as "the new taste of Coca-Cola" until 1992, when it was renamed Coke Ⅱ.  Coca-Cola's
          market share had been losing ground to diet soft drinks and non-cola beverages
          for many years.
        - Consumers who were purchasing regular colas seemed to prefer the sweeter
          taste of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind taste
          tests.
      - Pepsi:
        - Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink produced and manufactured by PepsiCo.
        - Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced
          as Brad's Drink, it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28, 1898, and then
          as Pepsi in 1961.
        - The drink Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink" in New Bern, North
          Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore
          where the drink was sold.
        - It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 after the root of the word "dyspepsia"
          and the kola nuts used in the recipe.
        - The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla.
        - Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid
          in digestion and boost energy.
      - Coca-Cola:
        - Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink produced by The Coca-Cola
          Company.
        - Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th
          century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler,
          whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink
          market throughout the 20th century.
        - The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola
          nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves.
        - The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety
          of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.
      - Pepsi Globe:
        - The Pepsi Globe is the icon and logo for Pepsi, called as such because of
          the swirling "red, white, & blue" design in a sphere-like shape.
        - It is considered one of the world's most recognizable corporate trademarks.
        - The Pepsi Globe originated in the 1940s as a logo and icon for Pepsi.
        - The colors of the Pepsi Globe are red, white and blue.
        - This is one of the most recognizable logos not only in the United States,
          but also around the world.
        - The Pepsi Globe has undergone several changes throughout its inception in
          the 1940s with the most recent pivot taking place in 2009.
        - This change was the most intense in terms of the amount of money and time
          that went into the branding, marketing, and visual culture involved in the
          underlying message for the logo.
      - Cola wars:
        - The cola wars are a series of mutually-targeted television advertisements
          and marketing campaigns since the 1980s between two long-time rival soft
          drink producers, The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo.
        - The battle between the two dominant brands in the United States intensified
          to such an extent that the term “Cola wars” was used to describe the feud.
        - Each employed numerous advertising and marketing campaigns to outdo the
          other.
        - Short periods of intense competition between the two firms contrast with
          how the two firms avoid competition most of the time by focusing on different
          consumers, sponsoring different sports, differentiating their logos, choosing
          different colors for their packaging, and building different images for
          their brand.
      - Diet Pepsi:
        - Diet Pepsi and Diet Pepsi Classic Formula Blend are no-calorie carbonated
          cola soft drinks produced by PepsiCo, introduced in 1964 as a variant of
          Pepsi-Cola with no sugar.
        - First test marketed in 1963 under the name Patio Diet Cola, it was re-branded
          as "Diet Pepsi" the following year, becoming the first diet cola to be distributed
          on a national scale in the United States.
        - In the 1960s and 1970s its competition consisted of Tab, produced by The
          Coca-Cola Company, and Diet Rite soda, produced by Royal Crown.
        - Diet Coke was a later entrant to the diet cola market; though shortly after
          entering production in 1982 it became the primary competing diet cola to
          Diet Pepsi.
      - Edward Coke:
        - Sir Edward Coke ( "cook", ; 1 February 1552 – 3 September 1634) was an English
          barrister, judge and, later, opposition politician, who is considered to
          be the greatest jurist of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.
        - Born into a middle-class family, Coke was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge,
          before leaving to study at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the
          Bar on 20 April 1578.
        - As a barrister he took part in several notable cases, including "Slade's
          Case", before earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament,
          where he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House
          of Commons.

        Conference semifinals.
      - During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress,
