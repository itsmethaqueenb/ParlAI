      - Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture.
      - In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage,
        or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables,
        fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
        or cosmetic use.
      - Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
      - Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings
        with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants,
        to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in
        large or small containers grown inside or outside.
      - Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve
        a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
      - It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to
        be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.
      - Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest
        form of gardening.
      - Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks
        and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.
      - In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment,
        useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while
        undesirable species were eliminated.

      - Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture.
      - In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage,
        or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables,
        fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
        or cosmetic use.
      - Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
      - Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings
        with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants,
        to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in
        large or small containers grown inside or outside.
      - Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve
        a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
      - It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to
        be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.
      - Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest
        form of gardening.
      - Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks
        and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.
      - In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment,
        useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while
        undesirable species were eliminated.

        fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
        or cosmetic use.
      - Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.
      - Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings
        with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants,
        to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in
        large or small containers grown inside or outside.
      - Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve
        a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.
      - It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to
        be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.
      - Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest
        form of gardening.
      - Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks
        and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.
      - In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment,
        useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while
        undesirable species were eliminated.

          the north and the south of the Italian peninsula.
        - It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied
          in the world.
        - It influenced several cuisines around the world chiefly that of the United

      - Pickling:
        - Pickling is the process of preserving or expanding the lifespan of food
          by either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar.
        - The resulting food is called a "pickle", or, to prevent ambiguity, prefaced
          with the adjective "pickled".
        - The pickling procedure will typically affect the food's texture and flavor.
        - In East Asia, vinaigrette (vegetable oil and vinegar) is also used as a
          pickling medium.
        - Foods that are pickled include meats, fruits, eggs, and vegetables.
        - Another distinguishing characteristic is a pH of 4.6 or lower, which is
          sufficient to kill most bacteria.

      - Cuisine of the United States:
        - The cuisine of the United States reflects its history.

          number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter.
        - The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries,
          proportional to the influx of immigrants from many different nations; such
          influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.
        - Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American
          Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form
          the basis of American Cuisine.
        - When the colonists came to the colonies, they farmed animals for clothing
          and meat in a similar fashion to what they had done in Europe.
      - Sofrito:

        - Preparations may vary, but it typically consists of aromatic ingredients
          cut into small pieces and sauteed or braised in cooking oil.
        - In Spanish cuisine, sofrito consists of garlic, onion, paprika, and tomatoes
          cooked in olive oil.
        - This is known as or sometimes as in Portuguese-speaking nations, where only
          onions and olive oil are often essential, garlic and bay laurel leaves being
          the other most common ingredients.
        - In Brazilian cuisine, the verb encompasses also dishes that are fried in
          vegetable oil before being boiled or steamed, even when the actual fried
          seasoning is not there.
      - Regional street food:
        - Street foods, ready-to-eat food or drink sold in a street or other public
          place, such as a market or fair, by a hawker or vendor, often from a portable
          stall, have variations within both regions and cultures.
        - For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Viet Nam as
          being "fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing]
          heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of Thailand
          is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste... and fish sauce" with New York
          City's signature street food being the hot dog, although the offerings in
          New York also range from "spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk
          chicken to Belgian waffles."
      - Filipino cuisine:
        - 'Filipino cuisine (Filipino: "Lutuing Filipino" or "Pagkaing Filipino")
          is composed of the cuisines of 135 distinct ethno-linguistic tribes found
          within the Philippine archipelago, however, majority of mainstream Filipino
          dishes that compose Filipino cuisine are from the cuisines of the Bikol,
          Chabakano, Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Kapampangan, Meranaw, Pangasinan, Sebwano
          (or Bisaya), Tagalog, and Waray ethno-linguistic tribes.'
        - The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many
          centuries from their Austronesian origins (shared with Malaysian and Indonesian
          cuisines) to a mixed cuisine of Indian, Chinese, Spanish, and American influences,
          in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures
          of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients
          and the local palate.

          or city.
        - Urban agriculture can also involve animal husbandry, aquaculture, agroforestry,
          urban beekeeping, and horticulture.
        - These activities occur in peri-urban areas as well, and peri-urban agriculture
          may have different characteristics.
        - Urban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic and social development.
        - In the global north, it often takes the form of a social movement for sustainable
          communities, where organic growers, ‘foodies,’ and ‘locavores’ form social
          networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism.
      - Cuisine of the United States:
        - The cuisine of the United States reflects its history.
        - The European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a
          number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter.
        - The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries,

          and meat in a similar fashion to what they had done in Europe.
      - History of agriculture in the People's Republic of China:
        - In 4,000 years, China has been a nation of farmers.
        - By the time the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, virtually
          all arable land was under cultivation; irrigation and drainage systems constructed
          centuries earlier and intensive farming practices already produced relatively
          high yields.
        - But little prime virgin land was available to support population growth
          and economic development.
        - However, after a decline in production as a result of the Great Leap Forward
          (1958–60), agricultural reforms implemented in the 1980s increased yields
          and promised even greater future production from existing cultivated land.
      - Ancient Israelite cuisine:
        - Ancient Israelite cuisine refers to the food eaten by the ancient Israelites
          during a period of over a thousand years, from the beginning of the Israelite
          presence in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the Iron Age until the
          Roman period.
        - The dietary staples were bread, wine and olive oil, but also included legumes,
          fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat.
        - Religious beliefs, which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, shaped
          the Israelite diet.

          time, despite the introduction of new foodstuffs at various stages.
      - Agriculture in India:
        - The history of Agriculture in India dates back to Indus Valley Civilization
          Era and even before that in some parts of Southern India.
        - Today, India ranks second worldwide in farm output.
        - Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries accounted for
          13.7% of the GDP (gross domestic product) in 2013, about 50% of the workforce.
        - The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining
          with the country's broad-based economic growth.
        - Still, agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays
          a significant role in the overall socio-economic fabric of India.
      - Vegetable:
        - In everyday usage, vegetables are certain parts of plants that are consumed
          by humans as food as part of a savory meal.
        - Originally, the traditional term (still commonly used in biology) included
          the flowers, fruit, stems, leaves, roots, tubers, bark, seeds, and all other
          plant matter, although modern-day culinary usage of the term "vegetable"
          may exclude food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains,
          but include seeds such as pulses; the term "vegetable" is somewhat arbitrary,
          and can be largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition.
        - Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers
          and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the
          period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed.
      - Indian cuisine:
        - Indian cuisine comprises a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines
          native to the Indian subcontinent.
        - Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups,
          and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use
          locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
        - Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hindu,
          and cultural choices and traditions.
        - Also, Middle Eastern and Central Asian influences have occurred on North
          Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule.
        - Indian cuisine is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions
          with other societies.
