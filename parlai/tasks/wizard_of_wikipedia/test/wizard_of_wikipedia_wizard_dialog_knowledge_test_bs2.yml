        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected
        from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible
        latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into
        a visible image.

        Cinematography The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed
        and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business
        as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words
        ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning "to record",
        together meaning "recording motion."

        RGB color model The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red,
        green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad
        array of colors.

        RGB color model The name of the model comes from the initials of the three
        additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

        RGB color model The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing,
        representation and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions
        and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography.

        RGB color model Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had
        a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.

        RGB color model RGB is a "device-dependent" color model: different devices
        detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements
        (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and
        B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device
        over time.

        Red Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to
        orange and opposite violet.

        Red It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.

        Red It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model,
        and is the complementary color of cyan.

        Red Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to
        bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red
        burgundy.

        Red The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red
        color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite
        or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide.

        Shades of green Varieties of the color green may differ in hue, chroma (also
        called saturation or intensity) or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness),
        or in two or three of these qualities.

        Shades of green Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint
        being a green or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black.

        Shades of green A large selection of these various colors is shown below.

        Shades of green Green is common in nature, especially in plants.

        Shades of green Many plants are green mainly because of a complex chemical
        known as chlorophyll which is involved in photosynthesis.

        Shades of green Many shades of green have been named after plants or are related
        to plants.

        Color theory In the visual arts, color theory or colour theory is a body of
        practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color
        combination.

        Color theory There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on
        the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.

        Color theory Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings
        of Leone Battista Alberti (c.1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci
        (c.1490), a tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially
        within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton''s theory of color ("Opticks",
        1704) and the nature of primary colors.

        Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate The concept of linguistic
        relativity concerns the relationship between language and thought, specifically
        whether language influences thought, and, if so, how.

        Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate This question has led to
        research in multiple disciplines—especially anthropology, cognitive science,
        linguistics, and philosophy.

        Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate Among the most popular and
        controversial theories in this area of scholarly work is the theory of linguistic
        relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis).

        Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate An often-cited "strong version"
        of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in 1953, proposes that language structure
        determines how we perceive the world.

        Tertiary color A "tertiary color" is a color made by mixing full saturation
        of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color and none
        of a third primary color, in a given color space such as RGB, CMYK (more modern)
        or RYB (traditional).

        Tertiary color Tertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the
        RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel.

        Tertiary color These names are shown below.

        Tertiary color Another definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists
        such as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary colors are
        created by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple,
        purple-orange; or by intermixing complementary colors.

        Cinematography Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected
        from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible
        latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into
        a visible image.

        Cinematography The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed
        and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business
        as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words
        ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning "to record",
        together meaning "recording motion."

        Image stabilization Image stabilization (IS) is a family of techniques that
        reduce blurring associated with the motion of a camera or other imaging device
        during exposure.

        Image stabilization Generally, it compensates for pan and tilt (angular movement,
        equivalent to yaw and pitch) of the imaging device, though electronic image
        stabilization can also compensate for rotation.

        Image stabilization It is used in image-stabilized binoculars, still and video
        cameras, astronomical telescopes, and also smartphones, mainly the high-end.

        Image stabilization With still cameras, camera shake is particularly problematic
        at slow shutter speeds or with long focal length (telephoto or zoom) lenses.

        Camera A camera is an optical instrument for recording or capturing images,
        which may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both.

        Camera The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images
        constituting videos or movies.

        Camera The camera is a remote sensing device as it senses subjects without
        any contact  .

        Camera The word "camera" comes from "camera obscura", which means "dark chamber"
        and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external
        reality onto a flat surface.

        Camera The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura.

        Camera The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of

        Video camera tube The video camera tube was a type of cathode ray tube used
        to capture the television image prior to the introduction of charge-coupled
        devices (CCDs) in the 1980s.

        Video camera tube Several different types of tubes were in use from the early
        1930s to the 1980s.

        Video camera tube In these tubes, the cathode ray was scanned across an image
        of the scene to be broadcast.

        Video camera tube The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of
        the image on the target.

        Video camera tube The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size
        of the target, allowing 483 horizontal scan lines per image in the NTSC format,
        or 576 lines in PAL.

        Video camera tube Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons,
        "cathode rays," is known as a cathode ray tube (CRT).

        Digital cinematography Digital cinematography is the process of capturing
        (recording) a motion picture using digital image sensors rather than through
        film stock.

        Digital cinematography As digital technology has improved in recent years,
        this practice has become dominant.

        Digital cinematography Since the mid 2010s most of the movies across the world
        are captured as well as distributed digitally.

        Digital cinematography Many vendors have brought products to market, including
        traditional film camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors
        like RED, Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which
        have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like
        Sony, GoPro, and Panasonic.

        Color motion picture film Color motion picture film refers both to unexposed
        color photographic film in a format suitable for use in a motion picture camera,
        and to finished motion picture film, ready for use in a projector, which bears
        images in color.

        Color motion picture film The first color cinematography was by additive color
        systems such as the one patented by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested
        in 1902.

        Color motion picture film A simplified additive system was successfully commercialized
        in 1909 as Kinemacolor.

        Color motion picture film These early systems used black-and-white film to
        photograph and project two or more component images through different color
        filters.

        Color motion picture film Around 1920, the first practical subtractive color
        processes were introduced.

        Movie camera The movie camera, film camera or cine-camera is a type of photographic
        camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on an image sensor or on
        a film.

        Movie camera In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot
        at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images; each image constitutes
        a "frame".

        Movie camera This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism.

        Movie camera The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific
        speed, called the frame rate (number of frames per second).

        Movie camera While viewing at a particular frame rate, a person''s eyes and
        brain merge the separate pictures together to create the illusion of motion.

        History of film technology The history of film technology traces the development
        of film technology from the initial development of "moving pictures" at the
        end of 19th century to the present time.

        History of film technology Motion pictures were initially exhibited as a fairground
        novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of communication
        and entertainment in the 20th century.

        History of film technology Major developments in motion picture technology
        have included the adoption of synchronized motion picture sound, color motion
        picture film, and the adoption of digital film technologies to replace physical
        film stock at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and
        projectors.

        Citizen Kane Citizen Kane is a 1941 American mystery drama film by Orson Welles,
        its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star.

        Citizen Kane The picture was Welles''s first feature film.

        Citizen Kane Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy
        Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles.

        Citizen Kane Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest
        film of all time, "Citizen Kane" was voted as such in five consecutive British
        Film Institute "Sight & Sound" polls of critics, until it was displaced by
        "Vertigo" in the 2012 poll.

        35 mm film 35 mm film (millimeter) is the film gauge most commonly used for
        motion pictures and chemical still photography (see 135 film).

        35 mm film The name of the gauge refers to the width of the photographic film,
        which consists of strips 34.98 ±0.03 mm (1.377 ±0.001 inches) wide.

        35 mm film The standard negative pulldown for movies ("single-frame" format)
        is four perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames
        per foot of film.

        35 mm film For still photography, the standard frame has eight perforations
        on each side.

        35 mm film A variety of largely proprietary gauges were devised for the numerous
        camera and projection systems being developed independently in the late 19th
        century and early 20th century, ranging from 13 mm to 75 mm (0.51–2.95 in),
        as well as a variety of film feeding systems.

        Irving Berlin Irving Berlin (born Israel Beilin; May 11, 1888 – September
        22, 1989) was an American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of
        the greatest songwriters in American history.

        Irving Berlin His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook.

        Irving Berlin Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States
        at the age of five.

        Irving Berlin He published his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy", in 1907,
        receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international
        hit, "Alexander''s Ragtime Band" in 1911.

        Irving Berlin He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway.

        Irving Berlin "Alexander''s Ragtime Band" sparked an international dance craze
        in places as far away as Berlin''s native Russia, which also "flung itself
        into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania."

        in Technicolor and released by Paramount Pictures.

        Blue Skies (1946 film) The music, lyrics, and story were written by Irving
        Berlin, with most of the songs recycled from earlier works.

        Blue Skies (1946 film) As in "Holiday Inn" (1942), the film is designed to

        7 Blue Skies The group is well known for their high energy live performances,
        as well as for always performing barefoot.

        7 Blue Skies The band has since broken up.

        7 Blue Skies The band''s name was chosen following an email from producer
        Ron Saint Germain, in which Germain signed off "Good luck, 7 blue skies!"

        7 Blue Skies The band determined the name to mean "have a nice week," and
        decided to use the name.

        and 1917 for its improved passenger service between New York and Washington
        launched in the 1890s, collectively dubbed the Royal Blue Line.

        Royal Blue (train) Using variants such as the "Royal Limited" and "Royal Special"
        for individual "Royal Blue" trains, the B&O operated the service in partnership
        with the Reading Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey.

        Royal Blue (train) Principal intermediate cities served were Philadelphia,
        Wilmington, and Baltimore.

        Blue Train Races The Blue Train Races were a series of record-breaking attempts
        between automobiles and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

        Blue Train Races It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles
        race against the "Le Train Bleu", a train that ran between Calais and the
        French Riviera.

        Blue Train Races The rationale to beat the train was to compare the contemporary
        automotive performance with locomotive dominance; to showcase recent progress
        achieved by cars regarding reliability, durability, speed and comfort; to
        promote the cars, their marques and the adventurous persona of their drivers;
        and to establish automobiles as a viable and aspirational mode of transport
        for the individual traveller.

        Royal Blue Coach Services Royal Blue Express Services was a coach operator
        in the south and west of England from 1880 until 1986.

        Royal Blue Coach Services The Royal Blue business was founded in 1880 by Thomas
        Elliott in Bournemouth.

        Royal Blue Coach Services The business, at first known as Royal Blue & Branksome
        Mews, included the hire of every kind of horse-drawn vehicle, as well as coach
        building, saddlery and blacksmithing.

        Royal Blue Coach Services Elliott soon started a four-in-hand stagecoach service
        to connect Bournemouth to the railway at Holmsley.

        Royal Blue Coach Services That service became redundant when the railway was
        extended to Bournemouth in 1888, but by then Elliott had started running Royal
        Blue excursions by charabanc and coach around Bournemouth and the New Forest.

        Le Train Bleu The Calais-Mediterranée Express was a luxury French night express
        train which operated from 1886 to 2003.

        Le Train Bleu It gained international fame as the preferred train of wealthy
        and famous passengers between Calais and the French Riviera in the two decades
        before World War II.

        Le Train Bleu It was colloquially referred to as Le Train Bleu in French (which
        became its formal name after World War II) and the Blue Train in English because
        of its dark blue sleeping cars.

        Le Train Bleu In December 1883 the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits
        (CIWL) created its second luxury train after the Orient Express introduced
        in June earlier that year.

      knowledge: 'Cinematography Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography")
        is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or
        other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image
        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected
        from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible
        latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into
        a visible image.

        Cinematography The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed
        and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business
        as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words
        ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning "to record",
        together meaning "recording motion."

        Precursors of film Much of film as an art form grew out of several earlier
        traditions in the fields of (oral) storytelling and literature (relating to
        the screenplay), theatre (relating to the theatre director/film director,
        a cast of actors, a production team that can include a scenic or set designer,
        lighting designer, costume designer) and visual art.

        Precursors of film Especially after the silent film era sound design and music
        (relating to the soundtrack and film score) became important factors.

        Precursors of film The technology of film emerged mostly from developments
        and achievements in the fields of projection, lenses, photography and optics,
        with sound recording and reproduction becoming important after the silent
        film era.

        Eadweard Muybridge Eadweard Muybridge (; 9 April 1830 – 8 May 1904, born Edward
        James Muggeridge) was an English photographer important for his pioneering
        work in photographic studies of motion, and early work in motion-picture projection.

        Eadweard Muybridge He adopted the first name Eadweard as the original Anglo-Saxon
        form of Edward, and the surname Muybridge believing it to be similarly archaic.

        Eadweard Muybridge At age 20, he emigrated to America as a bookseller, first
        to New York, and then to San Francisco.

        Eadweard Muybridge Planning a return trip to Europe in 1860, he suffered serious
        head injuries in a stagecoach crash in Texas.

        Eadweard Muybridge He spent the next few years recuperating in England, where
        he took up professional photography, learning the wet-plate collodion process,
        and secured at least two British patents for his inventions.

        Proto-Cubism Proto-Cubism (also referred to as Protocubism, Pre-Cubism or
        Early Cubism) is an intermediary transition phase in the history of art chronologically
        extending from 1906 to 1910.

        Proto-Cubism Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings
        resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences
        and conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory, artist
        or discourse.

        Proto-Cubism With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century this
        period can be characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of
        form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with
        Fauvism).

        History of film technology The history of film technology traces the development
        of film technology from the initial development of "moving pictures" at the
        end of 19th century to the present time.

        History of film technology Motion pictures were initially exhibited as a fairground
        novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of communication
        and entertainment in the 20th century.

        History of film technology Major developments in motion picture technology
        have included the adoption of synchronized motion picture sound, color motion
        picture film, and the adoption of digital film technologies to replace physical
        film stock at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and
        projectors.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop Sallie Gardner at a Gallop, also known as The Horse
        in Motion, is a series of photographs consisting of a galloping horse, the
        result of a photographic experiment by Eadweard Muybridge on June 15, 1878.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop Sometimes cited as an early silent film, the series
        and later experiments like it were precursors to the development of motion
        pictures.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop The series consists of 24 photographs shot in rapid
        succession that were shown on a zoopraxiscope.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop It was released throughout 1878–1880.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop Muybridge was commissioned by Leland Stanford,
        the industrialist and horseman, who was interested in gait analysis.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop The purpose of the shoot was to determine whether
        a galloping horse ever lifts all four feet completely off the ground during
        the gait; at this speed, the human eye cannot break down the action.

        Chronophotography Chronophotography is an antique photographic technique from
        the Victorian era (beginning about 1867–68), which captures movement in several
        frames of print.

        Chronophotography These prints can be subsequently arranged either like animation
        cels or layered in a single frame.

        Chronophotography It is a predecessor to cinematography and moving film, involving
        a series of different cameras, originally created and used for the scientific
        study of movement.

        Chronophotography Chronophotography is defined as "a set of photographs of
        a moving object, taken for the purpose of recording and exhibiting successive
        phases of motion".

        Chronophotography The term "chronophotography" was coined by French physiologist
        Étienne-Jules Marey to describe photographs of movement from which measurements
        could be taken and motion could be studied.

        Optics Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties
        of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments
        that use or detect it.

        Optics Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and
        infrared light.

        Optics Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic
        radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.

        Optics Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic
        description of light.

        Optics Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often
        difficult to apply in practice.

        Photography Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating
        durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either
        electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
        material such as photographic film.

        Photography Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted
        from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a timed exposure.

        Photography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge
        at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Lens (optics) A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses
        a light beam by means of refraction.

        Lens (optics) A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material,
        while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses ("elements"), usually
        arranged along a common axis.

        Lens (optics) Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and
        are ground and polished or molded to a desired shape.

        Lens (optics) A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which
        refracts light without focusing.

        Lens (optics) Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation
        other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses,
        electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.

        History of photographic lens design The invention of the camera in the early
        19th century led to an array of lens designs intended for photography.

        History of photographic lens design The problems of photographic lens design,
        creating a lens for a task that would cover a large, flat image plane, were
        well known even before the invention of photography due to the development
        of lenses to work with the focal plane of the camera obscura.

        History of photographic lens design The early photographic experiments of
        Thomas Wedgwood, Nicéphore Niépce, Henry Fox Talbot, and Louis Daguerre all
        used simple single-element convex lenses.

        History of photographic lens design These lenses were found lacking.

        History of photographic lens design Simple lenses could not focus an image
        over a large flat film plane (Field curvature) and suffered from other optical
        aberrations.

        Color photography Color (or colour) photography is photography that uses media
        capable of reproducing colors.

        Color photography By contrast, black-and-white (monochrome) photography records
        only a single channel of luminance (brightness) and uses media capable only
        of showing shades of gray.

        Color photography In color photography, electronic sensors or light-sensitive
        chemicals record color information at the time of exposure.

        Color photography This is usually done by analyzing the spectrum of colors
        into three channels of information, one dominated by red, another by green
        and the third by blue, in imitation of the way the normal human eye senses
        color.

        Color photography The recorded information is then used to reproduce the original
        colors by mixing various proportions of red, green and blue light (RGB color,
        used by video displays, digital projectors and some historical photographic
        processes), or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions of
        the red, green and blue which are present in white light (CMY color, used
        for prints on paper and transparencies on film).

        Polarization (waves) Polarization (also polarisation) is a property applying
        to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical orientation of the oscillations.

        Polarization (waves) In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation
        is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations
        can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction.

        Polarization (waves) A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations
        traveling along a taut string "(see image)"; for example, in a musical instrument
        like a guitar string.

        Polarization (waves) Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations
        can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular
        to the string.

        Genius Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout history,
        many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind of activity.

        Genius There is no scientifically precise definition of genius, and the question
        of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject
        of debate, although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes
        creativity and eminent achievement.

        Genius Usually, genius is associated with talent, but many authors (for example
        Cesare Lombroso) systematically distinguish these terms.

        Genius In ancient Rome, the "genius" (plural in Latin "genii") was the guiding
        spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family "(gens)", or place "(genius loci)".

        Genius The noun is related to the Latin verb "genui, genitus", "to bring into
        being, create, produce", as well as to the Greek word for birth.

        Genius Because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed to indicate
        the presence of a particularly powerful "genius", by the time of Augustus,
        the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of "inspiration, talent".

      knowledge: 'Cinematography Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography")
        is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or
        other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image
        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected
        from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible
        latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into
        a visible image.

        Cinematography The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed
        and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business
        as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words
        ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning "to record",
        together meaning "recording motion."

        George Wallace Gouinlock George Wallace Gouinlock (August 1, 1861- February
        13, 1932) was a Toronto-based architect who was responsible for notable structures
        in Toronto.

        George Wallace Gouinlock Gouinlock was born in 1861 in Paris, Ontario to Walter
        & Elizabeth Gouinlock.

        George Wallace Gouinlock He married Georgina Watson in 1889 and had sons George
        Roper and Robert.

        George Wallace Gouinlock He trained in various cities (including Hamilton,
        Chicago and Milwaukee) towards becoming an architect.

        George Wallace Gouinlock He later moved to Winnipeg as a junior architect
        with Barber, Bowes & Barber.

        George Wallace Gouinlock He came to Toronto in 1888 and began a partnership
        with architect Francis S. Baker (as Gouinlock & Baker) from 1888 to 1890.

        Instrumental and value rationality People reason daily about what they ought
        to do and how they ought to act.

        Instrumental and value rationality They seem to reason in two distinct ways,
        identified as two kinds of reasoning-at-large or Rationality.

        Instrumental and value rationality They reason about legitimate ends—what
        they ought to do—and about efficient means—how they ought to achieve their
        ends.

        Instrumental and value rationality Since antiquity, scholars have accepted
        this dichotomy and assigned supreme importance to understanding both kinds
        of rationality, as the following quotes suggest:  Following the usage of German
        sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920), reasoning about means has been labeled
        instrumental rationality and reasoning about ends has been labeled value rationality.

        Yes Minister Yes Minister is a Political satire British sitcom written by
        Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn that was first transmitted on BBC Two from 1980
        to 1984, split over three seven-episode series.

        Yes Minister The sequel, Yes, Prime Minister, ran from 1986 to 1988.

        Yes Minister In total there were 38 episodes, of which all but one lasted
        half an hour.

        Yes Minister Almost all episodes ended with a variation of the title of the
        series spoken as the answer to a question posed by Hacker.

        Yes Minister Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio, and a stage play
        was produced in 2010, the latter leading to a new television series on UKTV
        Gold in 2013.

        Yes Minister Set principally in the private office of a British Cabinet minister
        in the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall, "Yes Minister"
        follows the ministerial career of the Rt Hon Jim Hacker MP, played by Paul
        Eddington.

        Doctorate A doctorate (from Latin "docere", "to teach") or doctor''s degree
        (from Latin "doctor", "teacher") or doctoral degree (from the ancient formalism
        "licentia docendi") is an academic degree awarded by universities that is,
        in most countries, a research degree that qualifies the holder to teach at
        the university level in the degree''s field, or to work in a specific profession.

        Doctorate There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being
        the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields,
        ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines.

        Doctorate In the United States and some other countries, there are also some
        types of vocational, technical, or "professional degrees" that are referred
        to as "doctorates" in their home countries, though they are not technically
        doctoral level as they are not research degrees and no defense of any dissertation
        or thesis is performed.

        Photography Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating
        durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either
        electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
        material such as photographic film.

        Photography Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted
        from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a timed exposure.

        Photography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge
        at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image

        Electromagnetic radiation In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation
        or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic
        field, propagating (radiating) through space-time, carrying electromagnetic
        radiant energy.

        Electromagnetic radiation It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible)
        light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays."

        Electromagnetic radiation Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists
        of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric
        and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum.

        Electromagnetic radiation The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular
        to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation,
        forming a transverse wave.

        Optics Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties
        of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments
        that use or detect it.

        Optics Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and
        infrared light.

        Optics Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic
        radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.

        Optics Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic
        description of light.

        Optics Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often
        difficult to apply in practice.

        X-ray crystallography X-ray crystallography is a technique used for determining
        the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline
        atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions.

        X-ray crystallography By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted
        beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density
        of electrons within the crystal.

        X-ray crystallography From this electron density, the mean positions of the
        atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their
        disorder, and various other information.

        X-ray crystallography Since many materials can form crystals—such as salts,
        metals, minerals, semiconductors, as well as various inorganic, organic, and
        biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development
        of many scientific fields.

        Digital camera A digital camera or digicam is a camera that captures photographs
        in digital memory.

        Digital camera Most cameras produced today are digital, and while there are
        still dedicated compact cameras on the market, the use of dedicated digital
        cameras is dwindling, as digital cameras are now incorporated into many devices
        ranging from mobile devices to vehicles.

        Digital camera However, expensive, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras
        are still commonly used by professionals.

        Digital camera Digital and movie cameras share an optical system, typically
        using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup
        device.

        Digital camera The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light
        to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic
        rather than chemical.

        ability, creative productivity, universality in genres or originality, typically
        to a degree that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain
        of knowledge.

        Genius Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout history,
        many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind of activity.

        Genius There is no scientifically precise definition of genius, and the question
        of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject
        of debate, although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes
        creativity and eminent achievement.

        Genius Usually, genius is associated with talent, but many authors (for example
        Cesare Lombroso) systematically distinguish these terms.

        Genius In ancient Rome, the "genius" (plural in Latin "genii") was the guiding
        spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family "(gens)", or place "(genius loci)".

        Genius The noun is related to the Latin verb "genui, genitus", "to bring into
        being, create, produce", as well as to the Greek word for birth.

        Genius Because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed to indicate
        the presence of a particularly powerful "genius", by the time of Augustus,
        the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of "inspiration, talent".

        IQ classification IQ classification is the practice by IQ test publishers
        of labeling IQ score ranges with category names such as "superior" or "average".

        IQ classification There are several publishers of tests of cognitive abilities.

        IQ classification No two publishers use exactly the same classification labels,
        which have changed from time to time since the beginning of intelligence testing
        in the early twentieth century.

        IQ classification IQ scores have been derived by two different methods since
        the advent of cognitive ability tests.

        IQ classification The first method historically was the "ratio IQ", based
        on estimating a "mental age" of the test-taker (rounded to a specified number
        of years and months), which was then divided by the test-taker''s "chronological
        age" (rounded to a specified number of years and months).

        Intelligence quotient An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total score derived
        from several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence.

        Intelligence quotient The abbreviation "IQ" was coined by the psychologist
        William Stern for the German term "Intelligenzquotient", his term for a scoring
        method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912
        book.

        Intelligence quotient Historically, IQ is a score obtained by dividing a person’s
        mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person’s
        chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months.

        Intelligence quotient The resulting fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain
        the IQ score.

        Environment and intelligence Environment and intelligence research investigates
        the impact of environment on intelligence.

        Environment and intelligence This is one of the most important factors in
        understanding human group differences in IQ test scores and other measures
        of cognitive ability.

        Environment and intelligence It is estimated that genes contribute about 20–40%
        of the variance in intelligence in childhood and about 80% in old age.

        Environment and intelligence Thus the environment and its interaction with
        genes account for a high proportion of the variation in intelligence seen
        in groups of young children, and for a small proportion of the variation observed
        in groups of mature adults.

        Environment and intelligence Historically, there has been great interest in
        the field of intelligence research to determine environmental influences on
        the development of cognitive functioning, in particular, fluid intelligence,
        as defined by its stabilization at 16 years of age.

        Race and intelligence The connection between race and intelligence has been
        a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the
        inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.

        Race and intelligence While tests have broadly shown differences in average
        scores based on self-identified race or ethnicity, there is considerable debate
        as to whether and to what extent those differences reflect environmental factors
        as opposed to genetic ones, as well as to the definitions of what "race" and
        "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined at all.

        Race and intelligence Currently, there is no non-circumstantial evidence that
        these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers
        believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible
        that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found.

        Cognitive epidemiology Cognitive epidemiology is a field of research that
        examines the associations between intelligence test scores (IQ scores or extracted
        "g"-factors) and health, more specifically morbidity (mental and physical)
        and mortality.

        Cognitive epidemiology Typically, test scores are obtained at an early age,
        and compared to later morbidity and mortality.

        Cognitive epidemiology In addition to exploring and establishing these associations,
        cognitive epidemiology seeks to understand causal relationships between intelligence
        and health outcomes.

        Cognitive epidemiology Researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured
        at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences.

        Intellectual giftedness Intellectual giftedness is an intellectual ability
        significantly higher than average.

        Intellectual giftedness It is a characteristic of children, variously defined,
        that motivates differences in school programming.

        Intellectual giftedness It is thought to persist as a trait into adult life,
        with various consequences studied in longitudinal studies of giftedness over
        the last century.

        Intellectual giftedness There is no generally agreed definition of giftedness
        for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions and most
        longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed people
        with IQs in the top two percent of the population – that is, IQs above 130.

        Lewis Terman Lewis Madison Terman (January 15, 1877 – December 21, 1956) was
        an American psychologist and author.

        Lewis Terman He was noted as a pioneer in educational psychology in the early
        20th century at the Stanford Graduate School of Education.

        Lewis Terman He is best known for his revision of the Stanford-Binet IQ test
        and for initiating the longitudinal study of children with high IQs called
        the Genetic Studies of Genius.

        Lewis Terman He was a prominent eugenicist and was a member of the Human Betterment
        Foundation.

        Lewis Terman He also served as president of the American Psychological Association.

        Lewis Terman A "Review of General Psychology" survey, published in 2002, ranked
        Terman as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with
        G. Stanley Hall.

        Logology (science of science) Logology ("the science of science") is the study
        of all aspects of science and of its practitioners—aspects philosophical,
        biological, psychological, societal, historical, political, institutional,
        financial.

        Logology (science of science) The term "logology" is used here as a synonym
        for the equivalent term "science of science" and the semi-equivalent term
        "sociology of science".

        Logology (science of science) The term "logology" is back-formed from ""-logy""
        (as in "geo"logy"", "anthropo"logy"", "socio"logy"", etc.)

        Logology (science of science) in the sense of the "study of study" or the
        "science of science"—or, more plainly, the "study of science".

        Logology (science of science) The word "logology" provides grammatical variants
        not available with the earlier terms "science of science" and "sociology of
        science"—"logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".

        Hochbegabtenstudium The Hochbegabtenstudium (, "College for the talented")
        is a programme in Germany that allows students of prerequisite intellectual
        ability (as shown on IQ tests) to attend college even if they do not hold
        the Abitur.

        Hochbegabtenstudium The Hochbegabtenstudium is also called Schülerstudium
        ("college for school-students") because many of the students, who benefit
        from it are still enrolled in school, while they attend college.

        Hochbegabtenstudium A person wishing to do the Hochbegabtenstudium must be
        of above average intellectual ability and must as a rule have completed at
        least 10th grade.

        Hochbegabtenstudium However some exceptions from that rule are made for very
        young students of superior intellectual ability, who are in a lower grade.

      knowledge: 'Cinematography Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography")
        is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or
        other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image
        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected
        from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera
        during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
        charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video
        file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible
        latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into
        a visible image.

        Cinematography The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed
        and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business
        as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words
        ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning "to record",
        together meaning "recording motion."

        Digital camera A digital camera or digicam is a camera that captures photographs
        in digital memory.

        Digital camera Most cameras produced today are digital, and while there are
        still dedicated compact cameras on the market, the use of dedicated digital
        cameras is dwindling, as digital cameras are now incorporated into many devices
        ranging from mobile devices to vehicles.

        Digital camera However, expensive, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras
        are still commonly used by professionals.

        Digital camera Digital and movie cameras share an optical system, typically
        using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup
        device.

        Digital camera The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light
        to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic
        rather than chemical.

        Digital camera back A digital camera back is a device that attaches to the
        back of a camera in place of the traditional negative film holder and contains
        an electronic image sensor.

        Digital camera back This lets cameras that were designed to use film take
        digital photographs.

        Digital camera back These camera backs are generally expensive by consumer
        standards (US$5000 and up) and are primarily built to be attached on medium-
        and large-format cameras used by professional photographers.

        Digital camera back Two sensor back types are commonly used: single shot back
        (non-scanning) and scan back.

        Digital camera back Some backs, primarily older ones, require multiple exposures
        to capture an image; generally one each for red, green, and blue.

        Digital photography Digital photography is a form of photography that uses
        cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture images focused
        by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic film.

        Digital photography The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer
        file ready for further digital processing, viewing, digital publishing or
        printing.

        Digital photography Until the advent of such technology, photographs were
        made by exposing light sensitive photographic film and paper, which was processed
        in liquid chemical solutions to develop and stabilize the image.

        Digital photography Digital photographs are typically created solely by computer-based
        photoelectric and mechanical techniques, without wet bath chemical processing.

        History of the camera The history of the camera can be traced much further
        back than the introduction of photography.

        History of the camera Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued
        to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes,
        calotypes, dry plates, film, and to the modern day with digital cameras.

        History of the camera The forerunner to the photographic camera was the "camera
        obscura".

        History of the camera Camera obscura (Latin for "dark room") is the natural
        optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side
        of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in
        that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on
        a surface opposite to the opening.

        Camera A camera is an optical instrument for recording or capturing images,
        which may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both.

        Camera The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images
        constituting videos or movies.

        Camera The camera is a remote sensing device as it senses subjects without
        any contact  .

        Camera The word "camera" comes from "camera obscura", which means "dark chamber"
        and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external
        reality onto a flat surface.

        Camera The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura.

        Camera The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of
        the human eye.

        IMAX IMAX is a 70 mm motion picture film format that displays images of greater
        size and resolution than conventional film systems.

        IMAX Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw developed
        the IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in
        Canada.

        IMAX Unlike conventional projectors, the film runs horizontally (see diagram
        sprocket holes) so that the image width is greater than the width of the film.

        IMAX Since 2002, some feature films have been converted into IMAX format for
        displaying in IMAX theatres, and some have also been partially shot in IMAX.

        IMAX IMAX is the most widely used system for special-venue film presentations.

        Ritz Dakota Digital The Ritz Dakota Digital is a type of point-and-shoot digital
        camera, introduced in July of 2003, and sold by the Ritz Camera Centers.

        Ritz Dakota Digital It has a digital photo resolution of 1.2 megapixels (1280
        pixels wide, 960 pixels high) and a storage capacity of 25 pictures.

        Ritz Dakota Digital When introduced, the Dakota Digital sparked massive interest,
        primarily due to its price tag: $10.99 (US Dollars).

        Ritz Dakota Digital At the time, a digital camera of similar resolution and
        functionality was in the $40–$70 range.

        Ritz Dakota Digital The reason for the low price was because the Dakota Digital
        was a "single-use camera", i.e.

        Ritz Dakota Digital the consumer takes the pictures, returns the camera to
        the store, and the pictures are returned to the consumer in print and CD-ROM
        format (after an additional $11 processing fee) while the camera is refurbished
        and resold.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera A digital single-lens reflex camera (also
        called a digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera that combines the optics
        and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor,
        as opposed to photographic film.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera The reflex design scheme is the primary
        difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera In the reflex design, light travels through
        the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either the
        viewfinder or the image sensor.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera The traditional alternative would be to
        have a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term "single lens" for this
        design.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera By using only one lens, the viewfinder of
        a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured
        by the camera''s sensor.
