      knowledge: 'Gardening Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants
        as part of horticulture.

        Gardening In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers,
        foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf
        vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes,
        or for medicinal or cosmetic use.

        Gardening Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.

        Gardening Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard
        plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous
        plants, to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to
        plants in large or small containers grown inside or outside.

        Gardening Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown,
        or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.

        Gardening It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and
        tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.

        Gardening Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the
        world''s oldest form of gardening.

        Gardening Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad
        river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.

        Gardening In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment,
        useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while
        undesirable species were eliminated.

        Urban agriculture Urban agriculture, urban farming, or urban gardening is
        the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in or around

        agroforestry, urban beekeeping, and horticulture.

        Urban agriculture These activities occur in peri-urban areas as well, and
        peri-urban agriculture may have different characteristics.

        Urban agriculture Urban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic
        and social development.

        Urban agriculture In the global north, it often takes the form of a social
        movement for sustainable communities, where organic growers, ‘foodies,’ and
        ‘locavores’ form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community
        holism.

        Cuisine of the United States The cuisine of the United States reflects its
        history.

        Cuisine of the United States The European colonization of the Americas yielded
        the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter.

        Cuisine of the United States The various styles continued expanding well into
        the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from
        many different nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation
        throughout the country.

        Cuisine of the United States Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking
        methods in early American Cuisine that have been blended with early European
        cooking methods to form the basis of American Cuisine.

        Cuisine of the United States When the colonists came to the colonies, they
        farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion to what they had
        done in Europe.

        People''s Republic of China was established in 1949, virtually all arable
        land was under cultivation; irrigation and drainage systems constructed centuries
        earlier and intensive farming practices already produced relatively high yields.

        History of agriculture in the People''s Republic of China But little prime
        virgin land was available to support population growth and economic development.

        History of agriculture in the People''s Republic of China However, after a
        decline in production as a result of the Great Leap Forward (1958–60), agricultural
        reforms implemented in the 1980s increased yields and promised even greater
        future production from existing cultivated land.

        stages.

        Vegetable In everyday usage, vegetables are certain parts of plants that are
        consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal.

        Vegetable Originally, the traditional term (still commonly used in biology)
        included the flowers, fruit, stems, leaves, roots, tubers, bark, seeds, and
        all other plant matter, although modern-day culinary usage of the term "vegetable"
        may exclude food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains,
        but include seeds such as pulses; the term "vegetable" is somewhat arbitrary,
        and can be largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition.

        Vegetable Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers
        and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the
        period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed.

        as part of horticulture.

        Gardening In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers,
        foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf
        vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes,
        or for medicinal or cosmetic use.

        Gardening Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.

        Gardening Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard
        plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous
        plants, to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to
        plants in large or small containers grown inside or outside.

        Gardening Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown,
        or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings.

        Gardening It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and
        tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.

        Gardening Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the
        world''s oldest form of gardening.

        Gardening Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad

        Guinea pig The domestic guinea pig or simply guinea pig ("Cavia porcellus"),
        also known as cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae
        and the genus "Cavia".

        Guinea pig Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family
        Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea in Africa.

        Guinea pig They originated in the Andes of South America; studies based on
        biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a
        closely related species of cavy such as "C. tschudii", and therefore do not
        exist naturally in the wild.

        Guinea pig The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture
        of many indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but
        also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.

        Intensive animal farming Intensive animal farming or industrial livestock
        production, also colloquially known as factory farming, is a production approach
        towards farm animals in order to maximize production output, while minimizing
        production costs.

        Intensive animal farming Intensive farming refers to animal husbandry, the
        keeping of livestock such as cattle, poultry, and fish at higher stocking
        densities than is usually the case with other forms of animal agriculture—a
        practice typical in industrial farming by agribusinesses.

        Intensive animal farming The main products of this industry are meat, milk
        and eggs for human consumption.

        Intensive animal farming There are issues regarding whether factory farming
        is sustainable or ethical.

        Animal husbandry Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with
        animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products.

        Animal husbandry It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising
        of livestock.

        Animal husbandry Husbandry has a long history, starting with the Neolithic
        revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards,
        antedating farming of the first crops.

        Animal husbandry By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt,
        cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms.

        Animal husbandry Major changes took place in the Columbian Exchange when Old
        World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural
        Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn
        cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists
        such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool.

        the Appalachian Mountains and upper Piedmont to northernmost Georgia and perhaps
        very rarely in some of the higher elevations in northeastern Alabama.

        Pinus strobus The Native American Haudenosaunee denominated it the "Tree of
        Peace".

        Pinus strobus It is known as the "Weymouth pine" in the United Kingdom, after

        Mountain pine beetle It has a hard black exoskeleton, and measures approximately
        5 mm, about the size of a grain of rice.

        Mountain pine beetle In western North America, the current outbreak of the
        mountain pine beetle and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas
        of lodgepole pine forest, including more than 16 million of the 55 million
        hectares of forest in British Columbia.

        Mountain pine beetle The current outbreak in the Rocky Mountain National Park
        began in 1996 and has caused the destruction of millions of acres of ponderosa

        Stamp collecting It has been one of the world''s most popular hobbies since
        the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service.

        Stamp collecting Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for

        Stamp collecting A philatelist may, but does not have to, collect stamps.

        Stamp collecting It is not uncommon for the term "philatelist" to be used
        to mean a stamp collector.

        Stamp collecting Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer
        enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details.

        Stamp collecting The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however,
        generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas

        and geographical aspects and also for the many subjects depicted on them,
        ranging from ships, horses, and birds to kings, queens and presidents.

        maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using
        a wide array of weapons.

        Quake (video game) The successor to id Software''s "Doom" series, "Quake"
        built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.

        Quake (video game) Unlike the "Doom" engine before it, the "Quake" engine
        offered full real-time 3D rendering and had early support for 3D acceleration
        through OpenGL.

        Quake (video game) After "Doom" helped popularize multiplayer deathmatches,
        "Quake" added various multiplayer options.

        Quake (video game) Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the

        Id Software id Software LLC (; see Company name) is an American video game
        developer headquartered in Dallas, Texas.

        Id Software The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of
        the computer company Softdisk, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game
        designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack).

        Id Software Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved.

        Id Software id Software made important technological developments in video
        game technologies for the PC (running MS-DOS and Windows), including work
        done for the "Wolfenstein", "Doom", and "Quake" franchises.

        Id Software id''s work was particularly important in 3D computer graphics
        technology and in game engines that are heavily used throughout the video
        game industry.

        Machinima Machinima ( or ) is the use of real-time computer graphics engines
        to create a cinematic production.

        Machinima Most often video games are used to generate the computer animation.

        Machinima Machinima-based artists, sometimes called machinimists or machinimators,

        Video game music Video game music is the soundtrack that accompanies video
        games.

        Video game music Early video game music was once limited to simple melodies
        of early sound synthesizer technology.

        Video game music These limitations inspired the style of music known as chiptunes,
        which combines simple melodic styles with more complex patterns or traditional
        music styles, and became the most popular sound of the first video games.

        Video game music With advances in technology, video game music has now grown
        to include the same breadth and complexity associated with television and
        film scores, allowing for much more creative freedom.

        Video game music While simple synthesizer pieces are still common, game music
        now includes full orchestral pieces and popular music.

        Speedrun A speedrun is a play-through (or a recording thereof) of a video

        Speedrun Speedruns may cover a whole game or a selected part, such as a single
        level.

        Speedrun While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are
        characterized by additional rules that players promise to obey, such as collecting

        Speedrun Players attempt speedruns mainly to challenge themselves and to entertain

        and to spot ways to improve the completion time further.
