      text: 'Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative,
        fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted
        by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory
        perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft,
        robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction
        films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to
        explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes
        derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of
        or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot
        logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.

        I think science fiction is an amazing genre for anything. Future science,
        technology, time travel, FTL travel, they''re all such interesting concepts.'

      text: 'Homebrewing is the brewing of beer on a small scale for personal, non-commercial
        purposes. Beer has been brewed on the domestic level since its advent, thousands
        of years prior to its commercial production, although its legality has varied
        according to local regulation. Beer has been brewed domestically throughout
        its 7,000-year history, beginning in the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia (modern
        Iraq), Egypt and China. It seems to have first developed as thick beers; during
        this time meads, fruit wines and rice wines were also developed. Women brewers
        dominated alcohol production on every occupied continent until commercialization
        and industrialization of brewing occurred. The tradition of brewing being
        in the domain of women stemmed from the fact that brewing was a by-product
        of gathering, and often considered a part of baking. The Greeks and Romans
        cultivated both grape wine and beer, to a lesser extent. Roman women often
        directed production in larger households while the labor was performed by
        slaves. By the Tang dynasty, homebrewing seems to have been a familiar domestic
        chore in China, albeit the lower classes had to make do with poorly-filtered
        mash. Laws against making alcohol were enacted and repealed between the Zhou
        and Ming dynasties.
