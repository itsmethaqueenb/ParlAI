        chosen_Science_fiction_0: Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi)
          is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts
          such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster
          than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.

      - Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative
        fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science
        and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel
        universes, and extraterrestrial life.
      - Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and
        other innovations, and has been called a "literature of ideas".
      - It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.
      - Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science,
        but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.
      - Science fiction is difficult to define, as it includes a wide range of subgenres
        and themes.
      - 'Hugo Gernsback, who suggested the term "scientifiction" for his "Amazing
        Stories" magazine, wrote: "By ''scientifiction'' I mean the Jules Verne, H.
        G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled
        with scientific fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales
        make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive.'
      - They supply knowledge... in a very palatable form... New adventures pictured
        for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization
        tomorrow...

      - Hyperspace (science fiction):
        - Hyperspace is a faster-than-light (FTL) method of traveling used in science
          fiction.
        - It is typically described as an alternative "sub-region" of space co-existing
          with our own universe which may be entered using an energy field or other
          device.
        - As seen in most fiction hyperspace is most succinctly described as a "somewhere
          else" within which the laws of general and special relativity decidedly
          do "not" apply – especially with respect to the speed of light being the
          cosmic speed limit.
        - Entering and exiting said "elsewhere" thus directly enables travel near
          or faster than the speed of light – almost universally with the aid of extremely
          advanced technology.

        - Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative
          fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic
          science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel,

        - Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science,
          but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.
      - History of science fiction:
        - The literary genre of science fiction is diverse, and its exact definition
          remains a contested question among both scholars and devotees.
        - This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history,
          particularly over determining its exact origins.
        - There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre's roots
          in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian "Epic of Gilgamesh" (earliest
          Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).
        - A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime
          between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution
          and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics.
      - Science fiction film:
        - Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative,
          fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted
          by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds,
          extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements
          such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies.
        - Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social
          issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.
        - In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by
          filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific
          plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally
          held.
      - Time travel:
        - Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous
          to movement between different points in space by an object or a person,
          typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form
          of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime, either
          to an earlier time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling
          body to experience the intervening period in the usual sense.
        - Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.
        - It was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel "The Time Machine", which
          moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination.
      - List of starships in Stargate:
        - This is a list of fictional starships in the "Stargate" universe depicted
          through a series of television shows and three feature-length movies.
        - The Ancients are one of the most technologically advanced races in "Stargate",
          and this is reflected in their starships.
        - Duplicates of these ships are utilized by their nanite creations, the Asurans,
          as they also possess knowledge of Ancient technology.
        - The Puddle Jumper or Jumper is a small spacecraft used extensively in the
          "Stargate Atlantis" series.
        - Puddle Jumpers were created by the Ancients and most exist within the city
          built by the Ancients known as Atlantis.
      - History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950:
        - Science fiction and fantasy magazines began to be published in the US in
          the 1920s.
        - Stories with science fiction themes had been appearing for decades in pulp
          magazines such as "Argosy", but there were no magazines that specialized
          in a single genre until 1915, when Street & Smith, one of the major pulp
          publishers, brought out "Detective Story Magazine".
        - The first magazine to focus solely on fantasy and horror was "Weird Tales",
          which was launched in 1923, and established itself as the leading weird
          fiction magazine over the next two decades; writers such as H.P.
        - Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard became regular contributors.

      - Right to Internet access:
        - The right to Internet access, also known as the right to broadband or freedom
          to connect, is the view that all people must be able to access the Internet
          in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom of expression and
          opinion and other fundamental human rights, that states have a responsibility
          to ensure that Internet access is broadly available, and that states may
          not unreasonably restrict an individual's access to the Internet.
        - In December 2003 the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was
          convened under the auspice of the United Nations.
        - 'After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses and civil society
          representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted reaffirming

          on the types and levels of Internet censorship and surveillance that is
          occurring in countries around the world.
        - Detailed country by country information on Internet censorship and surveillance
          is provided in the "Freedom on the Net" reports from Freedom House, by the
          OpenNet Initiative, by Reporters Without Borders, and in the "Country Reports
          on Human Rights Practices" from the U.S. State Department Bureau of Democracy,

      - Digital divide in Canada:
        - The digital divide in Canada refers to the discrepancy that exists between
          Canadians who have access to information and communication technologies
          (ICT) and the benefits they provide compared to those who don't.
        - This divide can be the result of many factors including high costs for technology
          and online access, differences in the availability of online connectivity
          resources in different locations across the country, and lacking digital
          literacy.
        - The digital divide in Canada also stems from income inequality among Canadians
          and differences in online connectivity practices exhibited by those of different
          age, gender, first language, and cultural background.
      - Digital divide by country:
        - The digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access
          to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT).
        - Factors causing the divide can vary depending on the country and culture,
          as can the potential solutions for minimizing or closing the divide.
        - The following is a list of countries that have a digital divide along with
          contributing factors and steps the country is taking to resolve the issue.
        - The digital divide in Argentina is the term used to describe the technological
          and connectivity gap between different demographics and regions, specifically
          the gaps present in the country of Argentina.
      - Albert State School:
        - Albert State School is a heritage-listed state school with war memorial
          at 210-220 Albert Street, Maryborough, Fraser Coast Region, Queensland,
          Australia.
        - It was designed by Robert Ferguson and built in 1883 by George William and
          Edwin Negus.
        - It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 November 2014.
        - Albert State School in Maryborough opened in 1883 in a substantial new building
          designed by architect, Robert Ferguson, in a period when the town was undergoing
          major expansion and during the establishment of important institutions.
        - As Maryborough grew, the school expanded to include other structures and
          landscape elements.
      - National broadband plan:
        - Broadband is a term normally considered to be synonymous with a high-speed
          connection to the internet.
        - Suitability for certain applications, or technically a certain quality of
          service, is often assumed.
        - For instance, low round trip delay (or "latency" in milliseconds) would
          normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable for Voice over IP,
          online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage, virtual private networks
          and other latency-sensitive applications.
        - This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently high-latency.
        - In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in
          seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or security (say
          AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are often also
          assumed or defined as requirements.

          character, or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from the
          hetero-normative.
        - Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed
          at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature
          by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions
          have on depictions of sexuality and gender.

      - Internet access:
        - Internet access is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect
          to the Internet using computer terminals, computers, and other devices;
          and to access services such as email and the World Wide Web.
        - Various technologies, at a wide range of speeds have been used by Internet
          service providers (ISPs) to provide this service.
        - Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly.
        - In 1995, only percent of the world's population had access, with well over
          half of those living in the United States, and consumer use was through
          dial-up.
        - By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed nations
          used faster broadband technology, and by 2014, 41 percent of the world's
          population had access, broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global
          average connection speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s.
      - Internet censorship and surveillance by country:
        - This list of Internet censorship and surveillance by country provides information
          on the types and levels of Internet censorship and surveillance that is
          occurring in countries around the world.
        - Detailed country by country information on Internet censorship and surveillance
          is provided in the "Freedom on the Net" reports from Freedom House, by the
          OpenNet Initiative, by Reporters Without Borders, and in the "Country Reports
          on Human Rights Practices" from the U.S. State Department Bureau of Democracy,
          Human Rights, and Labor.
        - The ratings produced by several of these organizations are summarized below
          as well as in the Censorship by country article.
      - Digital divide by country:
        - The digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access
          to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT).
        - Factors causing the divide can vary depending on the country and culture,
          as can the potential solutions for minimizing or closing the divide.
        - The following is a list of countries that have a digital divide along with
          contributing factors and steps the country is taking to resolve the issue.
        - The digital divide in Argentina is the term used to describe the technological
          and connectivity gap between different demographics and regions, specifically
          the gaps present in the country of Argentina.
      - Digital divide in the United States:
        - The digital divide in the United States refers to inequalities between individuals,
          households, and other groups of different demographic and socioeconomic
          levels in "access" to information and communication technologies ("ICTs")
          and in the "knowledge and skills" needed to effectively use the information
          gained from connecting.
        - The global digital divide refers to inequalities in access, knowledge, and
          skills, but designates countries as the units of analysis and examines the
          divide between developing and developed countries on an international scale.
        - Although the digital divide in American has decreased considerably, there
          are still certain groups of Americans with limited access.
      - National broadband plan:
        - Broadband is a term normally considered to be synonymous with a high-speed
          connection to the internet.
        - Suitability for certain applications, or technically a certain quality of
          service, is often assumed.
        - For instance, low round trip delay (or "latency" in milliseconds) would
          normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable for Voice over IP,
          online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage, virtual private networks
          and other latency-sensitive applications.
        - This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently high-latency.
        - In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in
          seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or security (say
          AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are often also
          assumed or defined as requirements.
      - Right to Internet access:
        - The right to Internet access, also known as the right to broadband or freedom
          to connect, is the view that all people must be able to access the Internet
          in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom of expression and
          opinion and other fundamental human rights, that states have a responsibility
          to ensure that Internet access is broadly available, and that states may
          not unreasonably restrict an individual's access to the Internet.
        - In December 2003 the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was
          convened under the auspice of the United Nations.
        - 'After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses and civil society
          representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted reaffirming
          the importance of the Information Society to maintaining and strengthening
          human rights:  The WSIS Declaration of Principles makes specific reference
          to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information
          Society" in stating:  A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including
          14,306 Internet users, conducted for the BBC World Service between 30 November
          2009 and 7 February 2010 found that almost four in five Internet users and
          non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental
          right.'
      - Internet:
        - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that
          use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
        - It is a "network of networks" that consists of private, public, academic,
          business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a
          broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
        - The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services,
          such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World
          Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
        - The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United
          States Federal Government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication
          via computer networks.

      - Science fiction:
        - Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative
          fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic
          science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel,
          parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.
        - Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific
          and other innovations, and has been called a "literature of ideas".
        - It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.
        - Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science,
          but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.
      - Science fiction film:
        - Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative,
          fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted
          by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds,
          extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements
          such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies.
        - Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social
          issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.
        - In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by
          filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific
          plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally
          held.
      - History of science fiction:
        - The literary genre of science fiction is diverse, and its exact definition
          remains a contested question among both scholars and devotees.
        - This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history,
          particularly over determining its exact origins.
        - There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre's roots
          in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian "Epic of Gilgamesh" (earliest
          Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).
        - A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime
          between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution
          and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics.
      - Time travel:
        - Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous
          to movement between different points in space by an object or a person,
          typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form
          of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime, either
          to an earlier time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling
          body to experience the intervening period in the usual sense.
        - Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.
        - It was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel "The Time Machine", which
          moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination.
      - Parallel universes in fiction:
        - A parallel universe is a hypothetical self-contained reality co-existing
          with one's own.
        - A specific group of parallel universes are called a "multiverse", although
          this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that
          constitute reality.
        - While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally
          synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes
          an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that
          implies that the reality is a variant of our own.
        - The term "parallel universe" is more general, without any connotations implying
          a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe.
      - Alternate history:
        - Alternate history or alternative history (Commonwealth English), sometimes
          abbreviated as AH, is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which
          one or more historical events occur differently.
        - These stories usually contain "what if" scenarios at crucial points in history
          and present outcomes other than those in the historical record.
        - The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on fact.
        - Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science
          fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may use tropes from
          any or all of these genres.
        - Another term occasionally used for the genre is "allohistory" (literally
          "other history").
      - Time travel in fiction:
        - Time travel is a common theme in fiction and has been depicted in a variety
          of media, such as literature, television, film, and advertisements.
        - The concept of time travel by mechanical means was popularized in H. G.
          Wells' 1895 story, "The Time Machine".
        - In general, time travel stories focus on the consequences of traveling into
          the past or the future.
        - The central premise for these stories oftentimes involves changing history,
          either intentionally or by accident, and the ways by which altering the
          past changes the future and creates an altered present or future for the
          time traveler when they return home.

      - Internet access is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect
        to the Internet using computer terminals, computers, and other devices; and
        to access services such as email and the World Wide Web.
      - Various technologies, at a wide range of speeds have been used by Internet
        service providers (ISPs) to provide this service.
      - Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly.
      - In 1995, only percent of the world's population had access, with well over
        half of those living in the United States, and consumer use was through dial-up.
      - By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed nations
        used faster broadband technology, and by 2014, 41 percent of the world's population
        had access, broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global average
        connection speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s.
      - The Internet developed from the ARPANET, which was funded by the US government
        to support projects within the government and at universities and research
        laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include most of the world's
        large universities and the research arms of many technology companies.
      - Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the use of
        the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.

      - History of the Internet:
        - The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers
          in the 1950s.
        - Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer
          science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France.
        - The US Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s, including
          for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and
          managed by Lawrence Roberts.
        - The first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science
          Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los
          Angeles (UCLA) to the second network node at Stanford Research Institute
          (SRI).
      - List of smoking bans:
        - This is a list of smoking bans by country.
        - Smoking bans are public policies, including criminal laws and occupational
          safety and health regulations, which prohibit tobacco smoking in workplaces
          and/or other public spaces.
        - Legislation may also, in some cases, restrict the carrying or possessing
          of any lit tobacco product.
        - A law came into effect on 30 May 2007 restricting smoking in closed public
          areas and outlawing the advertisement of tobacco, although the measure was
          reportedly poorly enforced in the country until 2013.
        - From 2013 law enforcement has been implemented, and smoking is strictly
          forbidden in closed public areas, including bars, pubs, restaurants etc.
      - Road space rationing:
        - Road space rationing, also known as alternate-day travel, driving restriction,
          no-drive days, (; ; ) is a travel demand management strategy aimed to reduce
          the negative externalities generated by urban air pollution or peak urban
          travel demand in excess of available supply or road capacity, through artificially
          restricting demand (vehicle travel) by rationing the scarce common good
          road capacity, especially during the peak periods or during peak pollution
          events.
        - This objective is achieved by restricting traffic access into an urban cordon
          area, city center (CBD), or district based upon the last digits of the license
          number on pre-established days and during certain periods, usually, the
          peak hours.
      - Photography:
        - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable
          images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically
          by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
          material such as photographic film.
        - Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects
          into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during
          a timed exposure.
        - With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each
          pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file
          for subsequent display or processing.
      - Aerial photography:
        - Aerial photography is the taking of photographs from an aircraft or other
          flying object.
        - Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters,
          unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or "drones"), balloons, blimps and dirigibles,
          rockets, pigeons, kites, parachutes, stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted
          poles.
        - Mounted cameras may be triggered remotely or automatically; hand-held photographs
          may be taken by a photographer.
        - Aerial photography should not be confused with air-to-air photography, where
          one or more aircraft are used as chase planes that "chase" and photograph
          other aircraft in flight.
      - Freeware:
        - Freeware is software that is available for use at no monetary cost.
        - In other words, while freeware may be used without payment it is most often
          proprietary software, as usually modification, re-distribution or reverse-engineering
          without the author's permission is prohibited.
        - Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader.
        - There is no agreed set of rights or a license or an EULA which would define
          "freeware" unambiguously; every Freeware publisher defines their own rules
          for their Freeware.
        - For instance, redistribution of Freeware by third-parties is often permitted
          but there is a significant portion of Freeware which prohibits redistribution.
      - Fireworks:
        - Fireworks are a class of low explosive pyrotechnic devices used for aesthetic
          and entertainment purposes.
        - The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display (also
          called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced
          by firework devices.
        - Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places.
        - 'Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light,
          smoke, and floating materials (confetti for example).'
        - They may be designed to burn with colored flames and sparks including red,
          orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and silver.

        - The following is a list of magical objects used in the "Harry Potter" series.
        - In "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", Hermione Granger creates
          fake, enchanted Galleons that are used for communication between members
          of Dumbledore's Army.
        - Like real Galleons, the coins have numerals around the edge; on normal Galleons
          these serial numbers aren't used the same way the enchanted coins are used,
          the numbers represent the time and date of the next meeting, and automatically
          change to match whatever numbers Harry Potter sets on his coin.
        - Due to the coins being infused with a Protean Charm, once Harry Potter alters
          his, every coin changes to suit.
