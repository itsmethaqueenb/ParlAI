      now also sold in Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and South America,
      as well as New Zealand and South Africa as an imported good.
    - Variants include a version without high fructose corn syrup, Diet Dr Pepper,
      as well as a line of additional flavors, first introduced in the 2000s.

    - Soft drink:
      - A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that typically contains
        carbonated water (although lemonade, among others, is usually not carbonated),
        a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.
      - The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes
        (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these.
      - Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and other
        ingredients.
      - Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic beverages.
      - Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content
        must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is to be considered
        non-alcoholic.
    - Carbonated water:
      - Carbonated water (also known as sparkling water, seltzer water, seltzer, bubbly
        water, or fizzy water, or the closely related club soda or soda water) is
        water into which carbon dioxide gas under pressure has been dissolved.
      - Club soda or soda water may have additives, such as sodium chloride, sodium
        bicarbonate or similar, but seltzer water is almost always composed of water
        and carbon dioxide with no other additives.
      - Carbonation is the process that causes the water to become effervescent.
      - Most carbonated water is sold in ready to drink bottles like carbonated beverages
        such as soft drinks, but it can also be prepared at home with "soda makers".
    - Mountain Dew:
      - Mountain Dew (stylized as Mtn Dew) is a carbonated soft drink brand produced
        and owned by PepsiCo.
      - The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney
        and Ally Hartman.
      - A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958.
      - The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion,
        Virginia.
      - William H. "Bill" Jones of the Tip corporation further refined the formula,
        launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961.
      - In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired
        from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, at which point distribution expanded more
        widely across the United States and Canada.
    - 7 Up:
      - 7 Up (stylized as 7up outside the U.S.) is a brand of lemon-lime flavored,
        non-caffeinated soft drink.
      - The rights to the brand are held by Dr Pepper Snapple Group in the United
        States, and PepsiCo (or its licensees) in the rest of the world.
      - The U.S. version of the "7 Up" logo includes a red circle between the "7"
        and "Up"; this red circle has been animated and used as a mascot for the brand
        as Cool Spot.
      - 7 Up was created by Charles Leiper Grigg, who launched his St. Louis–based
        company The Howdy Corporation in 1920.
      - Grigg came up with the formula for a lemon-lime soft drink in 1929.
      - The product, originally named "Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda", was launched
        two weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929.

        not offered by other soft drink makers.
      - The company was founded by Peter van Stolk in 1986 as a beverage distributor
        in Western Canada.
      - Until 1995, the company distributed other beverage lines such as AriZona Iced
        Tea and Thomas Kemper sodas in Western Canada.
      - As the company gained significant knowledge of the beverage industry, it decided
        to get into the market with alternative beverages as the Urban Juice & Soda
        Company.

        must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is to be considered
        non-alcoholic.
    - Sugary drink tax:
      - A sugary drink tax or soda tax is a tax or surcharge designed to reduce consumption
        of drinks with added sugar.
      - Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated soft drinks, sports
        drinks and energy drinks.
      - The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and beverage producers
        like Coca-Cola often oppose it.
      - Advocates such as national medical associations and the World Health Organization
        (WHO) promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation, aimed to discourage
        unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs of obesity.
      - Type II Diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed and developing
        countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly due to type II
        diabetes in 2015 alone.
    - Diet drink:
      - Diet (alternatively marketed as sugar-free, zero-calorie or low-calorie) drinks
        are sugar-free, artificially sweetened versions of fizzy beverages with virtually
        no calories.
      - They are generally marketed toward health-conscious people, diabetics, athletes,
        and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness, or reduce
        their sugar intake.
      - The beginning of the diet drink or refreshment era was in 1952, when Kirsch
        Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar-free ginger ale called No-Cal.
      - It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained local.
      - Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in 1958 announcing
        a diet product, Diet Rite.
    - Energy drink:
      - An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs, usually
        including caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation
        (marketed as "energy", but distinct from food energy).
      - They may or may not be carbonated and many also contain sugar or other sweeteners,
        herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids.
      - They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars
        and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised to enhance
        sports performance.
      - There are many brands and varieties of energy drinks.
      - Coffee, tea and other naturally caffeinated beverages are usually not considered
        energy drinks.
    - Benzene in soft drinks:
      - Benzene in soft drinks is of potential concern due to the carcinogenic nature
        of the benzene molecule.
      - This contamination is a public health concern and has caused significant outcry
        among environmental and health advocates.
      - Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally and internationally,
        and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally in soft drinks.
      - The benzene forms from decarboxylation of the preservative benzoic acid in
        the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron and copper)
        that act as catalysts, especially under heat and light.
      - The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation of benzoic
        acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid
        (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).
    - Container deposit legislation:
      - Container-deposit legislation (also known as a deposit-refund scheme, bottle
        bill, or deposit-return system) is any law that requires the collection of
        a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable) at
        the point of sale.
      - When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer
        in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer
        (presumed to be the original purchaser).
      - It is a deposit-refund system.
      - 'Governments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons, including,
        for example:  Deposits that are not redeemed are often kept by distributors
        or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling fees paid
        to retailers or redemption enters to collect, sort, and handle the containers)
        or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to fund environmental
        programs.'
    - PepsiCo:
      - PepsiCo, Inc. is an American multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation
        headquartered in Purchase, New York.
      - PepsiCo has interests in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of
        grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products.
      - PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay,
        Inc. PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi to a broader
        range of food and beverage brands, the largest of which included an acquisition
        of Tropicana Products in 1998 and the Quaker Oats Company in 2001, which added
        the Gatorade brand to its portfolio.

        of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind taste tests.
    - Pepsi:
      - Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink produced and manufactured by PepsiCo.
      - Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced as
        Brad's Drink, it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28, 1898, and then as
        Pepsi in 1961.
      - The drink Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink" in New Bern, North
        Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore
        where the drink was sold.
      - It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 after the root of the word "dyspepsia" and
        the kola nuts used in the recipe.
      - The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla.
      - Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid
        in digestion and boost energy.
    - Coca-Cola:
      - Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink produced by The Coca-Cola Company.
      - Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th
        century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler,
        whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink
        market throughout the 20th century.
      - The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola
        nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves.
      - The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety
        of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.
    - Pepsi Globe:
      - The Pepsi Globe is the icon and logo for Pepsi, called as such because of
        the swirling "red, white, & blue" design in a sphere-like shape.
      - It is considered one of the world's most recognizable corporate trademarks.
      - The Pepsi Globe originated in the 1940s as a logo and icon for Pepsi.
      - The colors of the Pepsi Globe are red, white and blue.
      - This is one of the most recognizable logos not only in the United States,
        but also around the world.
      - The Pepsi Globe has undergone several changes throughout its inception in
        the 1940s with the most recent pivot taking place in 2009.
      - This change was the most intense in terms of the amount of money and time
        that went into the branding, marketing, and visual culture involved in the
        underlying message for the logo.
    - Cola wars:
      - The cola wars are a series of mutually-targeted television advertisements
        and marketing campaigns since the 1980s between two long-time rival soft drink
        producers, The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo.
      - The battle between the two dominant brands in the United States intensified
        to such an extent that the term “Cola wars” was used to describe the feud.
      - Each employed numerous advertising and marketing campaigns to outdo the other.
      - Short periods of intense competition between the two firms contrast with how
        the two firms avoid competition most of the time by focusing on different
        consumers, sponsoring different sports, differentiating their logos, choosing
        different colors for their packaging, and building different images for their
        brand.
    - Diet Pepsi:
      - Diet Pepsi and Diet Pepsi Classic Formula Blend are no-calorie carbonated
        cola soft drinks produced by PepsiCo, introduced in 1964 as a variant of Pepsi-Cola
        with no sugar.
      - First test marketed in 1963 under the name Patio Diet Cola, it was re-branded
        as "Diet Pepsi" the following year, becoming the first diet cola to be distributed
        on a national scale in the United States.
      - In the 1960s and 1970s its competition consisted of Tab, produced by The Coca-Cola
        Company, and Diet Rite soda, produced by Royal Crown.
      - Diet Coke was a later entrant to the diet cola market; though shortly after
        entering production in 1982 it became the primary competing diet cola to Diet
        Pepsi.
    - Edward Coke:
      - Sir Edward Coke ( "cook", ; 1 February 1552 – 3 September 1634) was an English
        barrister, judge and, later, opposition politician, who is considered to be
        the greatest jurist of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.
      - Born into a middle-class family, Coke was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge,
        before leaving to study at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the Bar
        on 20 April 1578.
      - As a barrister he took part in several notable cases, including "Slade's Case",
        before earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament, where
        he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House of Commons.
