      - Awesome! I really love how sci-fi storytellers focus on political/social/philosophical
        issues that would still be around even in the future. Makes them relatable.

      - It's not quite sci-fi, but my favorite version of time travel is in Harry
        Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Breaks zero logical rules.
      text: I agree. One of my favorite forms of science fiction is anything related
        to time travel! I find it fascinating.

      - If you really want a look at the potential negative consequences of scientific
        innovation, what you should check out is the TV show Fringe. Incredibly well
        written.
      text: And that's difficult to do when dealing with time travel. I actually haven't
        seen the latest Harry Potter movies. Guess it's time to check them out!

        research and laboratories in the United States...I am so glad they expanded
        it! '
      text: That is awesome. I wonder why it was restricted? Probably because they
        only wanted government and big companies to use it at first.
