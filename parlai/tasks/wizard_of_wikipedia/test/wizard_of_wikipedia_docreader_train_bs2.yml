        at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition as a new kind of soda pop, made
        with 23 flavors. Its introduction in 1885 preceded the introduction of Coca-Cola
        by one year. It was formulated by Brooklyn-born pharmacist Charles Alderton
        in Morrison''s Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas. To test his new drink,
        he first offered it to store owner Wade Morrison, who also found it to his
        liking. Patrons at Morrison''s soda fountain soon learned of Alderton''s new
        drink and began ordering a "Waco". Alderton gave the formula to Morrison,
        who named it Dr. Pepper (later stylized as "Dr Pepper").

        seven generations. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the GM

        the car after the type of small, maneuverable warship called a corvette. Originally

        late in the 1953 model year. Originally designed as a show car for the 1953
        Motorama display at the New York Auto Show, it generated enough interest to
        induce GM to make a production version to sell to the public. First production
        was on June 30, 1953. This generation was often referred to as the "solid-axle"
        models (the independent rear suspension was not introduced until the second
        generation). Three hundred hand-built polo white Corvette convertibles were
        produced for the 1953 model year. The 1954 model year vehicles could be ordered
        in Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, Black, or Polo White; 3,640 were built, and
        sold slowly.
