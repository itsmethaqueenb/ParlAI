        Existential risk from artificial general intelligence __knowledge__ Existential
        risk from artificial general intelligence is the theory that substantial progress
        in artificial intelligence (AI) could someday result in human extinction or
        some other unrecoverable global catastrophe.

        Existential risk from artificial general intelligence __knowledge__ One argument
        is as follows.

        Existential risk from artificial general intelligence __knowledge__ The human
        species currently dominates other species because the human brain has some
        distinctive capabilities that the brains of other animals lack.

        Existential risk from artificial general intelligence __knowledge__ If AI
        surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "superintelligent",
        then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control.

        Existential risk from artificial general intelligence __knowledge__ Just as
        the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill, so might the fate
        of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.

        Automation __knowledge__ Automation can be defined as the technology by which
        a process or procedure is performed without human assistance.

        Automation __knowledge__ In other words, Automation or automatic control,
        is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery,
        processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone
        networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications
        and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention, with some processes
        have been completely automated.

        Automation __knowledge__ Automation has been achieved by various means including
        mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices and computers,
        usually in combination.

        Robotic automation software __knowledge__ The term robotic automation or robotization
        refer to the automation of industrial and business processes using robots,
        of various guises.

        Robotic automation software __knowledge__ Robotic automation software refers
        to a class of software products used in that latter, clerical, context.

        Robotic automation software __knowledge__ Examples of robotic automation include
        the use of industrial robots in manufacturing and the use of software robots
        in automating business processes in services industries.

        Robotic automation software __knowledge__ In the latter case, the use of the
        term "robot" is metaphorical, conveying the similarity of those software products
        – which are produced to provide a generic automation capability and then configured
        within the end user environment to execute manual and repetitive tasks – to
        their industrial robot counterparts.

        Automation bias __knowledge__ Automation bias is the propensity for humans
        to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to ignore
        contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct.

        Automation bias __knowledge__ This problem has come under increasing scrutiny
        as decision making in such critical contexts as intensive care units, nuclear
        power plants, and aircraft cockpits have increasingly involved computerized
        system monitors and decision aids.

        Automation bias __knowledge__ Errors of automation bias tend to occur when
        decision-making involves a degree of dependence on computers or other automated
        aids and the human element is largely confined to monitoring the tasks underway.

        Human Element __knowledge__ Human Element was an online multiplayer video
        game under development by Robotoki for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and
        Xbox One.

        as indicated by a farewell message on Robotoki''s (now defunct) blog on January
        20, 2015, by the studio''s founder, Robert Bowling.

        Human Element __knowledge__ "Human Element" is the first game being developed
        by the independent game company Robotoki, which was formed by Robert Bowling
        after he left Infinity Ward following the release of "".

        Human Element __knowledge__ The premise of the game centers on the question,
        "What is the greatest threat in a zombie apocalypse?

        Human Element __knowledge__ "; Bowling believes it is the fear that the walking
        dead instill in the survivors, who lead them to do unreasonable things to
        survive.

        Internet of things __knowledge__ The Internet of things (IoT) is the network
        of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with
        electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which
        enables these objects to connect and exchange data.

        Internet of things __knowledge__ Each thing is uniquely identifiable through
        its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing
        Internet infrastructure.

        Internet of things __knowledge__ Experts estimate that the IoT will consist
        of about 30 billion objects by 2020.

        Internet of things __knowledge__ It is also estimated that the global market
        value of IoT will reach $7.1 trillion by 2020.

        Internet of things __knowledge__ The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled
        remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for
        more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems,
        and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition
        to reduced human intervention.

        Legalism (Chinese philosophy) __knowledge__ Fajia () or Legalism is one of
        Sima Tan''s six classical schools of thought in Chinese philosophy.

        Legalism (Chinese philosophy) __knowledge__ Roughly meaning "house of Fa"
        (administrative "methods" or "standards"), the "school" (term) represents
        some several branches of realistic statesmen or "men of methods" (fashu zishi)
        foundational for the traditional Chinese bureaucratic empire.

        Legalism (Chinese philosophy) __knowledge__ Compared with Machiavelli, it
        has often been considered in the Western world as akin to the Realpolitikal
        thought of ancient China.

        Legalism (Chinese philosophy) __knowledge__ Largely ignoring morality or questions
        on how a society ideally should function, they examined contemporary government;
        emphasizing a realistic consolidation of the wealth and power of autocrat
        and state, with the goal of achieving increased order, security and stability.

        Technological unemployment __knowledge__ Technological unemployment is the
        loss of jobs caused by technological change.

        Technological unemployment __knowledge__ Such change typically includes the
        introduction of labour-saving "mechanical-muscle" machines or more efficient
        "mechanical-mind" processes (automation).

        Technological unemployment __knowledge__ Just as horses employed as prime
        movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans'' jobs have
        also been affected throughout modern history.

        Technological unemployment __knowledge__ Historical examples include artisan
        weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanised looms.

        Technological unemployment __knowledge__ During World War II, Alan Turing''s
        Bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted
        data in a matter of hours.
