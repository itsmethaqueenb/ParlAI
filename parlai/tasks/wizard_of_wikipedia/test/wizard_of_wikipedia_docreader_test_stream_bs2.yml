      text: 'Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and
        traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between
        violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue
        when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450
        and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure
        contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime
        sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh
        scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.
        Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called
        atmospheric perspective. Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration
        since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient
        Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the
        pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century
        Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain.
        In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals.
        Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was
        replaced by the finer indigo from America.

        earlier works. As in "Holiday Inn" (1942), the film is designed to showcase

        made him one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, having sold
        over one billion analog records and tapes, and digital compact discs and downloads
        around the world. The first multimedia star, from 1931 to 1954 Crosby was
        a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses. His early
        career coincided with technical recording innovations such as the microphone.
        This allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced
        many of the popular male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank
        Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin.

        pickup device is electronic rather than chemical.

        productivity, universality in genres or originality, typically to a degree
        that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain of knowledge.
        Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout history, many
        geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind of activity. There
        is no scientifically precise definition of genius, and the question of whether
        the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject of debate,
        although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes creativity
        and eminent achievement. Usually, genius is associated with talent, but many
        authors (for example Cesare Lombroso) systematically distinguish these terms.
        In ancient Rome, the "genius" (plural in Latin "genii") was the guiding spirit
        or tutelary deity of a person, family "(gens)", or place "(genius loci)".
        The noun is related to the Latin verb "genui, genitus", "to bring into being,
        create, produce", as well as to the Greek word for birth. Because the achievements
        of exceptional individuals seemed to indicate the presence of a particularly
        powerful "genius", by the time of Augustus, the word began to acquire its
        secondary meaning of "inspiration, talent".
