      Soft drink A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that typically
      contains carbonated water (although lemonade, among others, is usually not carbonated),
      a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.

      Soft drink The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice,
      sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these.

      Soft drink Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives,
      and other ingredients.

      Soft drink Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic beverages.

      Soft drink Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the
      alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is to
      be considered non-alcoholic.

      Sugary drink tax A sugary drink tax or soda tax is a tax or surcharge designed
      to reduce consumption of drinks with added sugar.

      Sugary drink tax Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated soft
      drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks.

      Sugary drink tax The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and
      beverage producers like Coca-Cola often oppose it.

      Sugary drink tax Advocates such as national medical associations and the World
      Health Organization (WHO) promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation,
      aimed to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs of
      obesity.

      Sugary drink tax Type II Diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed
      and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly
      due to type II diabetes in 2015 alone.

      athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness,
      or reduce their sugar intake.

      Diet drink The beginning of the diet drink or refreshment era was in 1952, when
      Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar-free ginger ale called
      No-Cal.

      Diet drink It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained
      local.

      1958 announcing a diet product, Diet Rite.

      Energy drink An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs,
      usually including caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical

      other sweeteners, herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids.

      Energy drink They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which
      includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised
      to enhance sports performance.

      not considered energy drinks.

      Benzene in soft drinks Benzene in soft drinks is of potential concern due to
      the carcinogenic nature of the benzene molecule.

      Benzene in soft drinks This contamination is a public health concern and has
      caused significant outcry among environmental and health advocates.

      Benzene in soft drinks Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally
      and internationally, and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally
      in soft drinks.

      Benzene in soft drinks The benzene forms from decarboxylation of the preservative
      benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron
      and copper) that act as catalysts, especially under heat and light.

      Benzene in soft drinks The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation
      of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic
      acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).

      Container deposit legislation Container-deposit legislation (also known as a
      deposit-refund scheme, bottle bill, or deposit-return system) is any law that
      requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable
      or non-refillable) at the point of sale.

      Container deposit legislation When the container is returned to an authorized
      redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly
      or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser).

      Container deposit legislation It is a deposit-refund system.

      Container deposit legislation Governments may pass container deposit legislation
      for several reasons, including, for example:  Deposits that are not redeemed
      are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system
      (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect,
      sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity
      involved to fund environmental programs.

      Cola wars Each employed numerous advertising and marketing campaigns to outdo
      the other.
