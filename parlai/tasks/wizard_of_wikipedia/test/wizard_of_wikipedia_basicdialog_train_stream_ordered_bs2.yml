      - I agree. One of my favorite forms of science fiction is anything related to
        time travel! I find it fascinating.
      text: Awesome! I really love how sci-fi storytellers focus on political/social/philosophical
        issues that would still be around even in the future. Makes them relatable.

        commercial use of it began
      text: Oh me either! It seems like such a long time ago. I wonder when Internet

      - And that's difficult to do when dealing with time travel. I actually haven't
        seen the latest Harry Potter movies. Guess it's time to check them out!
      text: It's not quite sci-fi, but my favorite version of time travel is in Harry
        Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Breaks zero logical rules.

        research and laboratories in the United States...I am so glad they expanded
        it! '
      text: That is awesome. I wonder why it was restricted? Probably because they
        only wanted government and big companies to use it at first.

      text: If you really want a look at the potential negative consequences of scientific
        innovation, what you should check out is the TV show Fringe. Incredibly well
        written.
