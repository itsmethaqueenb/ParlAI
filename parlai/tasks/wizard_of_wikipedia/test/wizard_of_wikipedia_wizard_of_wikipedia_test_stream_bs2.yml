      - Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional
        colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model.
      - It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.
      - The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between
        approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.
      - Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green,
        while ultramarine contains some violet.
      - The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect
        known as Rayleigh scattering.
      - An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.
      - Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called
        atmospheric perspective.
      - Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times.
      - The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery
        and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine,
        the most expensive of all pigments.
      - In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue
        and white porcelain.
      - In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals.
      - Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was
        replaced by the finer indigo from America.

      - RGB color model:
        - The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue
          light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
        - The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary
          colors, red, green, and blue.
        - The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation
          and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers,
          though it has also been used in conventional photography.
        - Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory
          behind it, based in human perception of colors.
        - 'RGB is a "device-dependent" color model: different devices detect or reproduce
          a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors
          or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from
          manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time.'
      - Red:
        - Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange
          and opposite violet.
        - It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.
        - It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and
          is the complementary color of cyan.
        - Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red
          crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.
        - The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color
          of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite
          or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide.
      - Shades of green:
        - Varieties of the color green may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation
          or intensity) or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or
          three of these qualities.
        - Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a green
          or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black.
        - A large selection of these various colors is shown below.
        - Green is common in nature, especially in plants.
        - Many plants are green mainly because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll
          which is involved in photosynthesis.
        - Many shades of green have been named after plants or are related to plants.
      - Chicago White Sox:
        - The Chicago White Sox are an American professional baseball team based in
          Chicago.
        - The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of
          the American League (AL) Central division.
        - Home games are held at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South
          Side, and the team is owned by Jerry Reinsdorf.
        - They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago
          Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central division.
        - One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the franchise was
          established as a major league baseball club in .
        - The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings, but this was
          soon shortened to Chicago White Sox.
      - Color theory:
        - In the visual arts, color theory or colour theory is a body of practical
          guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination.
        - 'There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color
          wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.'
        - Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone
          Battista Alberti (c.1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c.1490),
          a tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially within
          a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color ("Opticks", 1704)
          and the nature of primary colors.
      - Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate:
        - The concept of linguistic relativity concerns the relationship between language
          and thought, specifically whether language influences thought, and, if so,
          how.
        - This question has led to research in multiple disciplines—especially anthropology,
          cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy.
        - Among the most popular and controversial theories in this area of scholarly
          work is the theory of linguistic relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf
          hypothesis).
        - An often-cited "strong version" of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in
          1953, proposes that language structure determines how we perceive the world.
      - Tertiary color:
        - A "tertiary color" is a color made by mixing full saturation of one primary
          color with half saturation of another primary color and none of a third
          primary color, in a given color space such as RGB, CMYK (more modern) or
          RYB (traditional).
        - Tertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the RGB color wheel
          and a different set for the RYB color wheel.
        - These names are shown below.
        - 'Another definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists such
          as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that tertiary colors are created
          by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange;
          or by intermixing complementary colors.'

      - Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography") is the science or
        art of motion-picture photography by recording light or other electromagnetic
        radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically
        by means of a light-sensitive material such as film stock.
      - Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected from objects
        into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a questioned
        exposure, creating multiple images.
      - With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each
        pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent
        display or processing.
      - The result with photographic emulsion is a series of invisible latent images
        on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed" into a visible image.
      - The images on the film stock are played back at a rapid speed and projected
        onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.
      - Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business as well as
        for entertainment purposes and mass communication.
      - The word "cinematography" was created from the Greek words ("kinema"), meaning
        "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning "to record", together meaning
        "recording motion."

      - Cinematography:
        - Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography") is the science or
          art of motion-picture photography by recording light or other electromagnetic
          radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically
          by means of a light-sensitive material such as film stock.
        - Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected from objects
          into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a
          questioned exposure, creating multiple images.
        - With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each
          pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for
          subsequent display or processing.
      - Color motion picture film:
        - Color motion picture film refers both to unexposed color photographic film
          in a format suitable for use in a motion picture camera, and to finished
          motion picture film, ready for use in a projector, which bears images in
          color.
        - The first color cinematography was by additive color systems such as the
          one patented by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested in 1902.
        - A simplified additive system was successfully commercialized in 1909 as
          Kinemacolor.
        - These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project
          two or more component images through different color filters.
        - Around 1920, the first practical subtractive color processes were introduced.
      - Movie camera:
        - The movie camera, film camera or cine-camera is a type of photographic camera
          which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on an image sensor or on a film.
        - In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time,
          the movie camera takes a series of images; each image constitutes a "frame".
        - This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism.
        - The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed,
          called the frame rate (number of frames per second).
        - While viewing at a particular frame rate, a person's eyes and brain merge
          the separate pictures together to create the illusion of motion.
      - History of film technology:
        - The history of film technology traces the development of film technology
          from the initial development of "moving pictures" at the end of 19th century
          to the present time.
        - Motion pictures were initially exhibited as a fairground novelty and developed
          into one of the most important tools of communication and entertainment
          in the 20th century.
        - Major developments in motion picture technology have included the adoption
          of synchronized motion picture sound, color motion picture film, and the
          adoption of digital film technologies to replace physical film stock at
          both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors.
      - Citizen Kane:
        - Citizen Kane is a 1941 American mystery drama film by Orson Welles, its
          producer, co-screenwriter, director and star.
        - The picture was Welles's first feature film.
        - Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award
          for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles.
        - Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film
          of all time, "Citizen Kane" was voted as such in five consecutive British
          Film Institute "Sight & Sound" polls of critics, until it was displaced
          by "Vertigo" in the 2012 poll.
        - It topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in
          1998, as well as its 2007 update.
      - Digital cinematography:
        - Digital cinematography is the process of capturing (recording) a motion
          picture using digital image sensors rather than through film stock.
        - As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become
          dominant.
        - Since the mid 2010s most of the movies across the world are captured as
          well as distributed digitally.
        - Many vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film
          camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors like RED,
          Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which have traditionally
          focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like Sony, GoPro, and
          Panasonic.
      - 35 mm film:
        - 35 mm film (millimeter) is the film gauge most commonly used for motion
          pictures and chemical still photography (see 135 film).
        - The name of the gauge refers to the width of the photographic film, which
          consists of strips 34.98 ±0.03 mm (1.377 ±0.001 inches) wide.
        - The standard negative pulldown for movies ("single-frame" format) is four
          perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames per
          foot of film.
        - For still photography, the standard frame has eight perforations on each
          side.
        - A variety of largely proprietary gauges were devised for the numerous camera
          and projection systems being developed independently in the late 19th century
          and early 20th century, ranging from 13 mm to 75 mm (0.51–2.95 in), as well
          as a variety of film feeding systems.

      - Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional
        colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model.
      - It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.
      - The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between
        approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.
      - Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green,
        while ultramarine contains some violet.
      - The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect
        known as Rayleigh scattering.
      - An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.
      - Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called
        atmospheric perspective.
      - Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times.
      - The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery
        and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine,
        the most expensive of all pigments.
      - In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue
        and white porcelain.
      - In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals.
      - Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was
        replaced by the finer indigo from America.

        - The Royal Blue was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O)'s flagship passenger
          train between New York City and Washington, D.C., in the United States,
          beginning in 1890.
        - The Baltimore-based B&O also used the name between 1890 and 1917 for its
          improved passenger service between New York and Washington launched in the
          1890s, collectively dubbed the Royal Blue Line.
        - Using variants such as the "Royal Limited" and "Royal Special" for individual
          "Royal Blue" trains, the B&O operated the service in partnership with the
          Reading Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey.
        - Principal intermediate cities served were Philadelphia, Wilmington, and
          Baltimore.
      - Blue Train Races:
        - The Blue Train Races were a series of record-breaking attempts between automobiles
          and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
        - It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles race
          against the "Le Train Bleu", a train that ran between Calais and the French
          Riviera.
        - The rationale to beat the train was to compare the contemporary automotive
          performance with locomotive dominance; to showcase recent progress achieved
          by cars regarding reliability, durability, speed and comfort; to promote
          the cars, their marques and the adventurous persona of their drivers; and
          to establish automobiles as a viable and aspirational mode of transport
          for the individual traveller.
      - Royal Blue Coach Services:
        - Royal Blue Express Services was a coach operator in the south and west of
          England from 1880 until 1986.
        - The Royal Blue business was founded in 1880 by Thomas Elliott in Bournemouth.
        - The business, at first known as Royal Blue & Branksome Mews, included the
          hire of every kind of horse-drawn vehicle, as well as coach building, saddlery
          and blacksmithing.
        - Elliott soon started a four-in-hand stagecoach service to connect Bournemouth
          to the railway at Holmsley.
        - That service became redundant when the railway was extended to Bournemouth
          in 1888, but by then Elliott had started running Royal Blue excursions by
          charabanc and coach around Bournemouth and the New Forest.
      - Le Train Bleu:
        - The Calais-Mediterranée Express was a luxury French night express train
          which operated from 1886 to 2003.
        - It gained international fame as the preferred train of wealthy and famous
          passengers between Calais and the French Riviera in the two decades before
          World War II.
        - It was colloquially referred to as Le Train Bleu in French (which became
          its formal name after World War II) and the Blue Train in English because
          of its dark blue sleeping cars.
        - In December 1883 the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) created
          its second luxury train after the Orient Express introduced in June earlier
          that year.
      - The Mystery of the Blue Train:
        - The Mystery of the Blue Train is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie,
          first published in the United Kingdom by William Collins & Sons on 29 March
          1928 and in the United States by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same
          year.
        - The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US
          edition at $2.00.
        - The book features her detective Hercule Poirot.
        - Poirot boards Le Train Bleu, bound for the French Riviera.
        - So does Katherine Grey, who is having her first winter out of England, after
          recently receiving a relatively large inheritance.
        - On board the train Grey meets Ruth Kettering, an American heiress leaving
          her unhappy marriage to meet her lover.
      - British Army mess dress:
        - British Army mess dress is the formal military evening dress worn by British
          Army officers and senior non-commissioned officers in their respective messes
          or at other formal occasions.
        - Mess uniforms first appeared in the British Army in about 1845, initially
          utilizing the short shell jacket worn since 1831.
        - This working jacket was worn open over a regimental waistcoat for evening
          dress.
        - The original purpose was to provide a relatively comfortable and inexpensive
          alternative to the stiff and elaborate full-dress uniforms then worn by
          officers for evening social functions such as regimental dinners or balls.
      - Los Angeles Rams:
        - The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in
          the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
        - The Rams compete in the National Football League (NFL), as a member club
          of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division.
        - The Rams franchise has won three NFL championships, and is the only franchise
          to win championships while representing three different cities (Cleveland
          in 1945, Los Angeles in 1951, and St. Louis in 1999).
        - The Rams play their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los
          Angeles, California.
        - The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams, located in Cleveland,
          Ohio.

      - Image stabilization:
        - Image stabilization (IS) is a family of techniques that reduce blurring
          associated with the motion of a camera or other imaging device during exposure.
        - Generally, it compensates for pan and tilt (angular movement, equivalent
          to yaw and pitch) of the imaging device, though electronic image stabilization
          can also compensate for rotation.
        - It is used in image-stabilized binoculars, still and video cameras, astronomical
          telescopes, and also smartphones, mainly the high-end.
        - With still cameras, camera shake is particularly problematic at slow shutter
          speeds or with long focal length (telephoto or zoom) lenses.
      - Camera:
        - A camera is an optical instrument for recording or capturing images, which
          may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both.
        - The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images constituting
          videos or movies.
        - The camera is a remote sensing device as it senses subjects without any
          contact  .
        - The word "camera" comes from "camera obscura", which means "dark chamber"
          and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of
          external reality onto a flat surface.
        - The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura.
        - The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the
          human eye.

          dating from the era of the Cold War, which have been achieved by inventors
          who are either native-born or naturalized citizens of the United States.
        - 'Copyright protection secures a person''s right to his or her first-to-invent
          claim of the "original" invention in question, highlighted in Article I,

      - Video camera tube:
        - The video camera tube was a type of cathode ray tube used to capture the
          television image prior to the introduction of charge-coupled devices (CCDs)
          in the 1980s.
        - Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s to the
          1980s.
        - In these tubes, the cathode ray was scanned across an image of the scene
          to be broadcast.
        - The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of the image on the
          target.
        - The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size of the target,
          allowing 483 horizontal scan lines per image in the NTSC format, or 576
          lines in PAL.
        - Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons, "cathode
          rays," is known as a cathode ray tube (CRT).

      - Nothing Records:
        - Nothing Records was an American record label specializing in industrial
          rock and electronic music, founded by John Malm Jr. and Trent Reznor in
          1992.
        - It is considered an example of a vanity label, where an artist is able to
          run a label with some degree of independence from within a larger parent
          company—in this case, Interscope Records was the parent company.
        - Nothing Records became largely defunct in 2004 due to a lawsuit by Reznor
          against John Malm.
        - The label became inactive as a whole following several further releases—the
          "Beside You in Time" (February 2007) home video was the label's final release.
      - Irving Berlin:
        - Irving Berlin (born Israel Beilin; May 11, 1888 – September 22, 1989) was
          an American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of the greatest
          songwriters in American history.
        - His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook.
        - Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age
          of five.
        - He published his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy", in 1907, receiving
          33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international
          hit, "Alexander's Ragtime Band" in 1911.
        - He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway.
        - '"Alexander''s Ragtime Band" sparked an international dance craze in places
          as far away as Berlin''s native Russia, which also "flung itself into the
          ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania."'
      - Blue Skies (1946 film):
        - Blue Skies is a 1946 American musical comedy film directed by Stuart Heisler
          and starring Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, and Joan Caulfield.
        - Based on a story by Irving Berlin, the film is about a dancer who loves
          a showgirl who loves a compulsive nightclub-opener who can't stay committed
          to anything in life for very long.
        - Produced by Sol C. Siegel, "Blue Skies" was filmed in Technicolor and released
          by Paramount Pictures.
        - The music, lyrics, and story were written by Irving Berlin, with most of
          the songs recycled from earlier works.

      - 7 Blue Skies:
        - 7 Blue Skies is an alternative rock band formed in 2004.
        - The group is well known for their high energy live performances, as well
          as for always performing barefoot.
        - The band has since broken up.
        - The band's name was chosen following an email from producer Ron Saint Germain,
          in which Germain signed off "Good luck, 7 blue skies!"
        - The band determined the name to mean "have a nice week," and decided to
          use the name.
        - This was later revealed to be a typo, as the intended line was "Good luck
          & blue skies!"
        - (the & is located above the 7 key).
        - Jon Shaffer, Adam Schulman and Andy Stickel formed the band and posted an
          ad online for a singer and drummer in 2004.
      - Lloyd Cole (album):
        - Lloyd Cole, also known as The X Album, is the debut solo album by English
          singer, songwriter and musician Lloyd Cole released on February 21, 1990
          by Polydor and Capitol.
        - Previously Cole was best known for his work with The Commotions but this
          album marked a departure from their signature sound and an opportunity for
          him to collaborate with other musicians and explore new ideas.
        - Following the release of "Mainstream", and limited touring and promotion
          in support of it, Cole left the Commotions.
        - The chance to write and record new types of songs was the motivating factor.
        - He also believed that the group had reached a natural conclusion and he
          no longer wanted the pressure and responsibility of managing a band.
      - Sarah Platt:

      - Optics:
        - Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties
          of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of
          instruments that use or detect it.
        - Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared
          light.
        - Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic
          radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.
        - Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic
          description of light.
        - Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult
          to apply in practice.
      - Photography:
        - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable
          images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically
          by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
          material such as photographic film.
        - Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects
          into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during
          a timed exposure.
        - With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each
          pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file
          for subsequent display or processing.
      - Lens (optics):
        - A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses a light
          beam by means of refraction.
        - A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while
          a compound lens consists of several simple lenses ("elements"), usually
          arranged along a common axis.
        - Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground
          and polished or molded to a desired shape.
        - A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts
          light without focusing.
        - Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than
          visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron
          lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.
      - History of photographic lens design:
        - The invention of the camera in the early 19th century led to an array of
          lens designs intended for photography.
        - The problems of photographic lens design, creating a lens for a task that
          would cover a large, flat image plane, were well known even before the invention
          of photography due to the development of lenses to work with the focal plane
          of the camera obscura.
        - The early photographic experiments of Thomas Wedgwood, Nicéphore Niépce,
          Henry Fox Talbot, and Louis Daguerre all used simple single-element convex
          lenses.
        - These lenses were found lacking.
        - Simple lenses could not focus an image over a large flat film plane (Field
          curvature) and suffered from other optical aberrations.
      - Color photography:
        - Color (or colour) photography is photography that uses media capable of
          reproducing colors.
        - By contrast, black-and-white (monochrome) photography records only a single
          channel of luminance (brightness) and uses media capable only of showing
          shades of gray.
        - In color photography, electronic sensors or light-sensitive chemicals record
          color information at the time of exposure.
        - This is usually done by analyzing the spectrum of colors into three channels
          of information, one dominated by red, another by green and the third by
          blue, in imitation of the way the normal human eye senses color.
        - The recorded information is then used to reproduce the original colors by
          mixing various proportions of red, green and blue light (RGB color, used
          by video displays, digital projectors and some historical photographic processes),
          or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions of the red, green
          and blue which are present in white light (CMY color, used for prints on
          paper and transparencies on film).
      - Polarization (waves):
        - Polarization (also polarisation) is a property applying to transverse waves
          that specifies the geometrical orientation of the oscillations.
        - In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is transverse to
          the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different
          directions perpendicular to the wave direction.
        - A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling
          along a taut string "(see image)"; for example, in a musical instrument
          like a guitar string.
        - Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical
          direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string.

      - Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional
        colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model.
      - It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.
      - The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between
        approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.
      - Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green,
        while ultramarine contains some violet.
      - The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect
        known as Rayleigh scattering.
      - An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.
      - Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called
        atmospheric perspective.
      - Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times.
      - The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery
        and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine,
        the most expensive of all pigments.
      - In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue
        and white porcelain.
      - In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals.
      - Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was
        replaced by the finer indigo from America.

      - Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll:
        - The Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll was published from a questionnaire given
          to movie exhibitors every year between 1932 and 2013 by Quigley Publishing

        - The list was based on a poll of movie theater owners, who were asked to
          name who they felt were the previous year's top 10 moneymaking stars.
        - 'The Top 10 Poll which appeared annually in Quigley''s "International Motion
          Picture Almanac" has long been regarded as one of the most reliable barometers
          of a movie star''s box-office power, as film exhibitors base their decisions

      - Precursors of film:
        - Much of film as an art form grew out of several earlier traditions in the
          fields of (oral) storytelling and literature (relating to the screenplay),
          theatre (relating to the theatre director/film director, a cast of actors,
          a production team that can include a scenic or set designer, lighting designer,
          costume designer) and visual art.
        - Especially after the silent film era sound design and music (relating to
          the soundtrack and film score) became important factors.
        - The technology of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements
          in the fields of projection, lenses, photography and optics, with sound
          recording and reproduction becoming important after the silent film era.
      - Eadweard Muybridge:
        - Eadweard Muybridge (; 9 April 1830 – 8 May 1904, born Edward James Muggeridge)
          was an English photographer important for his pioneering work in photographic
          studies of motion, and early work in motion-picture projection.
        - He adopted the first name Eadweard as the original Anglo-Saxon form of Edward,
          and the surname Muybridge believing it to be similarly archaic.
        - At age 20, he emigrated to America as a bookseller, first to New York, and
          then to San Francisco.
        - Planning a return trip to Europe in 1860, he suffered serious head injuries
          in a stagecoach crash in Texas.
        - He spent the next few years recuperating in England, where he took up professional
          photography, learning the wet-plate collodion process, and secured at least

        - Proto-Cubism (also referred to as Protocubism, Pre-Cubism or Early Cubism)
          is an intermediary transition phase in the history of art chronologically
          extending from 1906 to 1910.
        - Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings resulted
          from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences and
          conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory, artist
          or discourse.
        - With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century this period
          can be characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form
          and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with Fauvism).
      - History of film technology:
        - The history of film technology traces the development of film technology
          from the initial development of "moving pictures" at the end of 19th century
          to the present time.
        - Motion pictures were initially exhibited as a fairground novelty and developed
          into one of the most important tools of communication and entertainment
          in the 20th century.
        - Major developments in motion picture technology have included the adoption
          of synchronized motion picture sound, color motion picture film, and the
          adoption of digital film technologies to replace physical film stock at
          both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors.
      - Sallie Gardner at a Gallop:
        - Sallie Gardner at a Gallop, also known as The Horse in Motion, is a series
          of photographs consisting of a galloping horse, the result of a photographic
          experiment by Eadweard Muybridge on June 15, 1878.
        - Sometimes cited as an early silent film, the series and later experiments
          like it were precursors to the development of motion pictures.
        - The series consists of 24 photographs shot in rapid succession that were
          shown on a zoopraxiscope.
        - It was released throughout 1878–1880.
        - Muybridge was commissioned by Leland Stanford, the industrialist and horseman,
          who was interested in gait analysis.
        - The purpose of the shoot was to determine whether a galloping horse ever
          lifts all four feet completely off the ground during the gait; at this speed,
          the human eye cannot break down the action.
      - Chronophotography:
        - Chronophotography is an antique photographic technique from the Victorian
          era (beginning about 1867–68), which captures movement in several frames
          of print.
        - These prints can be subsequently arranged either like animation cels or
          layered in a single frame.
        - It is a predecessor to cinematography and moving film, involving a series
          of different cameras, originally created and used for the scientific study
          of movement.
        - Chronophotography is defined as "a set of photographs of a moving object,
          taken for the purpose of recording and exhibiting successive phases of motion".
        - The term "chronophotography" was coined by French physiologist Étienne-Jules
          Marey to describe photographs of movement from which measurements could
          be taken and motion could be studied.
      - Cinematography:
        - Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography") is the science or
          art of motion-picture photography by recording light or other electromagnetic
          radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically
          by means of a light-sensitive material such as film stock.
        - Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus the light reflected from objects
          into real images on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a
          questioned exposure, creating multiple images.
        - With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each
          pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for
          subsequent display or processing.
