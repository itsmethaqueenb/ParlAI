        full saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary
        color and none of a third primary color, in a given color space such as RGB,
        CMYK (more modern) or RYB (traditional).

        Tertiary color __knowledge__ Tertiary colors have general names, one set of
        names for the RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel.

        Tertiary color __knowledge__ These names are shown below.

        Tertiary color __knowledge__ Another definition of tertiary color is provided
        by color theorists such as Moses Harrisand Josef Albers, who suggest that
        tertiary colors are created by intermixing pairs of secondary colors: orange-green,
        green-purple, purple-orange; or by intermixing complementary colors.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography")
        is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or
        other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image
        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus
        the light reflected from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface
        inside a camera during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ With an electronic image sensor, this produces
        an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and
        stored in a video file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The result with photographic emulsion is a series
        of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed"
        into a visible image.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The images on the film stock are played back
        at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science
        and business as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The word "cinematography" was created from the
        Greek words ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning
        "to record", together meaning "recording motion."

        Photography __knowledge__ Photography is the science, art, application and
        practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic
        radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically
        by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.

        Photography __knowledge__ Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected
        or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside
        a camera during a timed exposure.

        Image stabilization __knowledge__ Image stabilization (IS) is a family of
        techniques that reduce blurring associated with the motion of a camera or
        other imaging device during exposure.

        Image stabilization __knowledge__ Generally, it compensates for pan and tilt
        (angular movement, equivalent to yaw and pitch) of the imaging device, though
        electronic image stabilization can also compensate for rotation.

        Image stabilization __knowledge__ It is used in image-stabilized binoculars,
        still and video cameras, astronomical telescopes, and also smartphones, mainly
        the high-end.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography")
        is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or
        other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image
        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus
        the light reflected from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface
        inside a camera during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ With an electronic image sensor, this produces
        an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and
        stored in a video file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The result with photographic emulsion is a series
        of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed"
        into a visible image.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The images on the film stock are played back
        at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science
        and business as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The word "cinematography" was created from the
        Greek words ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning
        "to record", together meaning "recording motion."

        Precursors of film __knowledge__ Much of film as an art form grew out of several
        earlier traditions in the fields of (oral) storytelling and literature (relating
        to the screenplay), theatre (relating to the theatre director/film director,
        a cast of actors, a production team that can include a scenic or set designer,
        lighting designer, costume designer) and visual art.

        Precursors of film __knowledge__ Especially after the silent film era sound
        design and music (relating to the soundtrack and film score) became important
        factors.

        Precursors of film __knowledge__ The technology of film emerged mostly from
        developments and achievements in the fields of projection, lenses, photography
        and optics, with sound recording and reproduction becoming important after
        the silent film era.

        Eadweard Muybridge __knowledge__ Eadweard Muybridge (; 9 April 1830 – 8 May
        1904, born Edward James Muggeridge) was an English photographer important
        for his pioneering work in photographic studies of motion, and early work
        in motion-picture projection.

        Eadweard Muybridge __knowledge__ He adopted the first name Eadweard as the
        original Anglo-Saxon form of Edward, and the surname Muybridge believing it
        to be similarly archaic.

        Eadweard Muybridge __knowledge__ At age 20, he emigrated to America as a bookseller,
        first to New York, and then to San Francisco.

        Eadweard Muybridge __knowledge__ Planning a return trip to Europe in 1860,
        he suffered serious head injuries in a stagecoach crash in Texas.

        Eadweard Muybridge __knowledge__ He spent the next few years recuperating
        in England, where he took up professional photography, learning the wet-plate
        collodion process, and secured at least two British patents for his inventions.

        Proto-Cubism __knowledge__ Proto-Cubism (also referred to as Protocubism,
        Pre-Cubism or Early Cubism) is an intermediary transition phase in the history
        of art chronologically extending from 1906 to 1910.

        Proto-Cubism __knowledge__ Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist
        paintings resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances,
        influences and conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory,
        artist or discourse.

        Proto-Cubism __knowledge__ With its roots stemming from at least the late
        19th century this period can be characterized by a move towards the radical
        geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette
        (in comparison with Fauvism).

        History of film technology __knowledge__ The history of film technology traces
        the development of film technology from the initial development of "moving
        pictures" at the end of 19th century to the present time.

        History of film technology __knowledge__ Motion pictures were initially exhibited
        as a fairground novelty and developed into one of the most important tools
        of communication and entertainment in the 20th century.

        History of film technology __knowledge__ Major developments in motion picture
        technology have included the adoption of synchronized motion picture sound,
        color motion picture film, and the adoption of digital film technologies to
        replace physical film stock at both ends of the production chain by digital
        image sensors and projectors.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop __knowledge__ Sallie Gardner at a Gallop, also
        known as The Horse in Motion, is a series of photographs consisting of a galloping
        horse, the result of a photographic experiment by Eadweard Muybridge on June
        15, 1878.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop __knowledge__ Sometimes cited as an early silent
        film, the series and later experiments like it were precursors to the development
        of motion pictures.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop __knowledge__ The series consists of 24 photographs
        shot in rapid succession that were shown on a zoopraxiscope.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop __knowledge__ It was released throughout 1878–1880.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop __knowledge__ Muybridge was commissioned by Leland
        Stanford, the industrialist and horseman, who was interested in gait analysis.

        Sallie Gardner at a Gallop __knowledge__ The purpose of the shoot was to determine
        whether a galloping horse ever lifts all four feet completely off the ground
        during the gait; at this speed, the human eye cannot break down the action.

        Chronophotography __knowledge__ Chronophotography is an antique photographic
        technique from the Victorian era (beginning about 1867–68), which captures
        movement in several frames of print.

        Chronophotography __knowledge__ These prints can be subsequently arranged
        either like animation cels or layered in a single frame.

        Chronophotography __knowledge__ It is a predecessor to cinematography and
        moving film, involving a series of different cameras, originally created and
        used for the scientific study of movement.

        Chronophotography __knowledge__ Chronophotography is defined as "a set of
        photographs of a moving object, taken for the purpose of recording and exhibiting
        successive phases of motion".

        Chronophotography __knowledge__ The term "chronophotography" was coined by
        French physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey to describe photographs of movement
        from which measurements could be taken and motion could be studied.

        Optics __knowledge__ Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour
        and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction
        of instruments that use or detect it.

        Optics __knowledge__ Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet,
        and infrared light.

        Optics __knowledge__ Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms
        of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit
        similar properties.

        Optics __knowledge__ Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the
        classical electromagnetic description of light.

        Optics __knowledge__ Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however,
        often difficult to apply in practice.

        Photography __knowledge__ Photography is the science, art, application and
        practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic
        radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically
        by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.

        Photography __knowledge__ Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected
        or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside
        a camera during a timed exposure.

        Photography __knowledge__ With an electronic image sensor, this produces an
        electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored
        in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing.

        Lens (optics) __knowledge__ A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses
        or disperses a light beam by means of refraction.

        Lens (optics) __knowledge__ A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent
        material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses ("elements"),
        usually arranged along a common axis.

        Lens (optics) __knowledge__ Lenses are made from materials such as glass or
        plastic, and are ground and polished or molded to a desired shape.

        Lens (optics) __knowledge__ A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike
        a prism, which refracts light without focusing.

        Lens (optics) __knowledge__ Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves
        and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave
        lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.

        History of photographic lens design __knowledge__ The invention of the camera
        in the early 19th century led to an array of lens designs intended for photography.

        History of photographic lens design __knowledge__ The problems of photographic
        lens design, creating a lens for a task that would cover a large, flat image
        plane, were well known even before the invention of photography due to the
        development of lenses to work with the focal plane of the camera obscura.

        History of photographic lens design __knowledge__ The early photographic experiments
        of Thomas Wedgwood, Nicéphore Niépce, Henry Fox Talbot, and Louis Daguerre
        all used simple single-element convex lenses.

        History of photographic lens design __knowledge__ These lenses were found
        lacking.

        History of photographic lens design __knowledge__ Simple lenses could not
        focus an image over a large flat film plane (Field curvature) and suffered
        from other optical aberrations.

        Color photography __knowledge__ Color (or colour) photography is photography
        that uses media capable of reproducing colors.

        Color photography __knowledge__ By contrast, black-and-white (monochrome)
        photography records only a single channel of luminance (brightness) and uses
        media capable only of showing shades of gray.

        Color photography __knowledge__ In color photography, electronic sensors or
        light-sensitive chemicals record color information at the time of exposure.

        Color photography __knowledge__ This is usually done by analyzing the spectrum
        of colors into three channels of information, one dominated by red, another
        by green and the third by blue, in imitation of the way the normal human eye
        senses color.

        Color photography __knowledge__ The recorded information is then used to reproduce
        the original colors by mixing various proportions of red, green and blue light
        (RGB color, used by video displays, digital projectors and some historical
        photographic processes), or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions
        of the red, green and blue which are present in white light (CMY color, used
        for prints on paper and transparencies on film).

        Polarization (waves) __knowledge__ Polarization (also polarisation) is a property
        applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical orientation of
        the oscillations.

        Polarization (waves) __knowledge__ In a transverse wave, the direction of
        the oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the
        oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction.

        Polarization (waves) __knowledge__ A simple example of a polarized transverse
        wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string "(see image)"; for example,
        in a musical instrument like a guitar string.

        Polarization (waves) __knowledge__ Depending on how the string is plucked,
        the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at
        any angle perpendicular to the string.

        Genius __knowledge__ Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout
        history, many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind
        of activity.

        Genius __knowledge__ There is no scientifically precise definition of genius,
        and the question of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long
        been a subject of debate, although psychologists are converging on a definition
        that emphasizes creativity and eminent achievement.

        Genius __knowledge__ Usually, genius is associated with talent, but many authors
        (for example Cesare Lombroso) systematically distinguish these terms.

        Genius __knowledge__ In ancient Rome, the "genius" (plural in Latin "genii")
        was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family "(gens)", or
        place "(genius loci)".

        Genius __knowledge__ The noun is related to the Latin verb "genui, genitus",
        "to bring into being, create, produce", as well as to the Greek word for birth.

        Genius __knowledge__ Because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed
        to indicate the presence of a particularly powerful "genius", by the time
        of Augustus, the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of "inspiration,
        talent".

        Instrumental and value rationality __knowledge__ People reason daily about
        what they ought to do and how they ought to act.

        Instrumental and value rationality __knowledge__ They seem to reason in two
        distinct ways, identified as two kinds of reasoning-at-large or Rationality.

        Instrumental and value rationality __knowledge__ They reason about legitimate
        ends—what they ought to do—and about efficient means—how they ought to achieve
        their ends.

        Instrumental and value rationality __knowledge__ Since antiquity, scholars
        have accepted this dichotomy and assigned supreme importance to understanding
        both kinds of rationality, as the following quotes suggest:  Following the
        usage of German sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920), reasoning about means has
        been labeled instrumental rationality and reasoning about ends has been labeled
        value rationality.

        electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space-time, carrying
        electromagnetic radiant energy.

        Electromagnetic radiation __knowledge__ It includes radio waves, microwaves,
        infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays."

        Electromagnetic radiation __knowledge__ Classically, electromagnetic radiation
        consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of
        electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through
        a vacuum.

        Electromagnetic radiation __knowledge__ The oscillations of the two fields
        are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy
        and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave.

        Optics __knowledge__ Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour
        and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction
        of instruments that use or detect it.

        Optics __knowledge__ Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet,
        and infrared light.

        Optics __knowledge__ Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms
        of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit
        similar properties.

        Optics __knowledge__ Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the
        classical electromagnetic description of light.

        Optics __knowledge__ Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however,
        often difficult to apply in practice.

        Glossary of video terms __knowledge__ This glossary defines terms that are
        used in the document "Defining Video Quality Requirements: A Guide for Public
        Safety", developed by the Video Quality in Public Safety (VQIPS) Working Group.

        Glossary of video terms __knowledge__ It contains terminology and explanations
        of concepts relevant to the video industry.

        Glossary of video terms __knowledge__ The purpose of the glossary is to inform
        the reader of commonly used vocabulary terms in the video domain.

        Glossary of video terms __knowledge__ This glossary was compiled from various
        industry sources.

        Glossary of video terms __knowledge__ A device that converts analog signals
        into digital signals.

        Glossary of video terms __knowledge__ A circuit for automatically controlling
        amplifier gain in order to maintain a constant output voltage with a varying
        input voltage within a predetermined range of input-to-output variation.

        X-ray crystallography __knowledge__ X-ray crystallography is a technique used
        for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which
        the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many
        specific directions.

        X-ray crystallography __knowledge__ By measuring the angles and intensities
        of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional
        picture of the density of electrons within the crystal.

        X-ray crystallography __knowledge__ From this electron density, the mean positions
        of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds,
        their disorder, and various other information.

        X-ray crystallography __knowledge__ Since many materials can form crystals—such
        as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, as well as various inorganic,
        organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental
        in the development of many scientific fields.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ A digital camera or digicam is a camera that
        captures photographs in digital memory.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ Most cameras produced today are digital, and
        while there are still dedicated compact cameras on the market, the use of
        dedicated digital cameras is dwindling, as digital cameras are now incorporated
        into many devices ranging from mobile devices to vehicles.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ However, expensive, high-end, high-definition
        dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ Digital and movie cameras share an optical system,
        typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image
        pickup device.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount
        of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic
        rather than chemical.

        Genius __knowledge__ A genius is a person who displays exceptional intellectual
        ability, creative productivity, universality in genres or originality, typically
        to a degree that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain
        of knowledge.

        Genius __knowledge__ Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout
        history, many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind
        of activity.

        Genius __knowledge__ There is no scientifically precise definition of genius,
        and the question of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long
        been a subject of debate, although psychologists are converging on a definition
        that emphasizes creativity and eminent achievement.

        Genius __knowledge__ Usually, genius is associated with talent, but many authors
        (for example Cesare Lombroso) systematically distinguish these terms.

        Genius __knowledge__ In ancient Rome, the "genius" (plural in Latin "genii")
        was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family "(gens)", or
        place "(genius loci)".

        Genius __knowledge__ The noun is related to the Latin verb "genui, genitus",
        "to bring into being, create, produce", as well as to the Greek word for birth.

        Genius __knowledge__ Because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed
        to indicate the presence of a particularly powerful "genius", by the time
        of Augustus, the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of "inspiration,
        talent".

        IQ classification __knowledge__ IQ classification is the practice by IQ test
        publishers of labeling IQ score ranges with category names such as "superior"
        or "average".

        IQ classification __knowledge__ There are several publishers of tests of cognitive
        abilities.

        IQ classification __knowledge__ No two publishers use exactly the same classification
        labels, which have changed from time to time since the beginning of intelligence
        testing in the early twentieth century.

        IQ classification __knowledge__ IQ scores have been derived by two different
        methods since the advent of cognitive ability tests.

        IQ classification __knowledge__ The first method historically was the "ratio
        IQ", based on estimating a "mental age" of the test-taker (rounded to a specified
        number of years and months), which was then divided by the test-taker''s "chronological
        age" (rounded to a specified number of years and months).

        Intelligence quotient __knowledge__ An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total
        score derived from several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence.

        Intelligence quotient __knowledge__ The abbreviation "IQ" was coined by the
        psychologist William Stern for the German term "Intelligenzquotient", his
        term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau
        he advocated in a 1912 book.

        Intelligence quotient __knowledge__ Historically, IQ is a score obtained by
        dividing a person’s mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence
        test, by the person’s chronological age, both expressed in terms of years
        and months.

        Intelligence quotient __knowledge__ The resulting fraction is multiplied by
        100 to obtain the IQ score.

        Environment and intelligence __knowledge__ Environment and intelligence research
        investigates the impact of environment on intelligence.

        Environment and intelligence __knowledge__ This is one of the most important
        factors in understanding human group differences in IQ test scores and other
        measures of cognitive ability.

        Environment and intelligence __knowledge__ It is estimated that genes contribute
        about 20–40% of the variance in intelligence in childhood and about 80% in
        old age.

        Environment and intelligence __knowledge__ Thus the environment and its interaction
        with genes account for a high proportion of the variation in intelligence
        seen in groups of young children, and for a small proportion of the variation
        observed in groups of mature adults.

        Environment and intelligence __knowledge__ Historically, there has been great
        interest in the field of intelligence research to determine environmental
        influences on the development of cognitive functioning, in particular, fluid
        intelligence, as defined by its stabilization at 16 years of age.

        Race and intelligence __knowledge__ The connection between race and intelligence
        has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research
        since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.

        Race and intelligence __knowledge__ While tests have broadly shown differences
        in average scores based on self-identified race or ethnicity, there is considerable
        debate as to whether and to what extent those differences reflect environmental
        factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as to the definitions of what
        "race" and "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined
        at all.

        Race and intelligence __knowledge__ Currently, there is no non-circumstantial
        evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although
        some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it
        at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually
        be found.

        Genius (website) __knowledge__ Genius (formerly Rap Genius) is a North American
        digital media company.

        Genius (website) __knowledge__ Originally founded in August 2009 by Tom Lehman,
        Ilan Zechory, and Mahbod Moghadam, the site allows users to provide annotations
        and interpretation of song lyrics, news stories, sources, poetry, and documents.

        Genius (website) __knowledge__ Originally launched as Rap Genius with a focus
        on hip-hop music, the company attracted the attention and support of celebrities,
        and venture capital enabling further growth.

        Genius (website) __knowledge__ The site expanded in 2014 to cover other forms
        of media, such as pop, literature, R&B, and added an annotation-embedded platform.

        Genius (website) __knowledge__ That same year, an iPhone app was released.

        Cognitive epidemiology __knowledge__ Cognitive epidemiology is a field of
        research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores (IQ
        scores or extracted "g"-factors) and health, more specifically morbidity (mental
        and physical) and mortality.

        Cognitive epidemiology __knowledge__ Typically, test scores are obtained at
        an early age, and compared to later morbidity and mortality.

        Cognitive epidemiology __knowledge__ In addition to exploring and establishing
        these associations, cognitive epidemiology seeks to understand causal relationships
        between intelligence and health outcomes.

        Cognitive epidemiology __knowledge__ Researchers in the field argue that intelligence
        measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality
        differences.

        Intellectual giftedness __knowledge__ Intellectual giftedness is an intellectual
        ability significantly higher than average.

        Intellectual giftedness __knowledge__ It is a characteristic of children,
        variously defined, that motivates differences in school programming.

        Intellectual giftedness __knowledge__ It is thought to persist as a trait
        into adult life, with various consequences studied in longitudinal studies
        of giftedness over the last century.

        Intellectual giftedness __knowledge__ There is no generally agreed definition
        of giftedness for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions
        and most longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed
        people with IQs in the top two percent of the population – that is, IQs above
        130.

        Lewis Terman __knowledge__ Lewis Madison Terman (January 15, 1877 – December
        21, 1956) was an American psychologist and author.

        Lewis Terman __knowledge__ He was noted as a pioneer in educational psychology
        in the early 20th century at the Stanford Graduate School of Education.

        Lewis Terman __knowledge__ He is best known for his revision of the Stanford-Binet
        IQ test and for initiating the longitudinal study of children with high IQs
        called the Genetic Studies of Genius.

        Lewis Terman __knowledge__ He was a prominent eugenicist and was a member
        of the Human Betterment Foundation.

        Lewis Terman __knowledge__ He also served as president of the American Psychological
        Association.

        Lewis Terman __knowledge__ A "Review of General Psychology" survey, published
        in 2002, ranked Terman as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century,
        in a tie with G. Stanley Hall.

        Logology (science of science) __knowledge__ Logology ("the science of science")
        is the study of all aspects of science and of its practitioners—aspects philosophical,
        biological, psychological, societal, historical, political, institutional,
        financial.

        Logology (science of science) __knowledge__ The term "logology" is used here
        as a synonym for the equivalent term "science of science" and the semi-equivalent
        term "sociology of science".

        Logology (science of science) __knowledge__ The term "logology" is back-formed
        from ""-logy"" (as in "geo"logy"", "anthropo"logy"", "socio"logy"", etc.)

        Logology (science of science) __knowledge__ in the sense of the "study of
        study" or the "science of science"—or, more plainly, the "study of science".

        Logology (science of science) __knowledge__ The word "logology" provides grammatical
        variants not available with the earlier terms "science of science" and "sociology
        of science"—"logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".

        Hochbegabtenstudium __knowledge__ The Hochbegabtenstudium (, "College for
        the talented") is a programme in Germany that allows students of prerequisite
        intellectual ability (as shown on IQ tests) to attend college even if they
        do not hold the Abitur.

        Hochbegabtenstudium __knowledge__ The Hochbegabtenstudium is also called Schülerstudium
        ("college for school-students") because many of the students, who benefit
        from it are still enrolled in school, while they attend college.

        Hochbegabtenstudium __knowledge__ A person wishing to do the Hochbegabtenstudium
        must be of above average intellectual ability and must as a rule have completed
        at least 10th grade.

        Hochbegabtenstudium __knowledge__ However some exceptions from that rule are
        made for very young students of superior intellectual ability, who are in
        a lower grade.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Cinematography (also called "Direction of Photography")
        is the science or art of motion-picture photography by recording light or
        other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image
        sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as film
        stock.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Typically, a lens is used to repeatedly focus
        the light reflected from objects into real images on the light-sensitive surface
        inside a camera during a questioned exposure, creating multiple images.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ With an electronic image sensor, this produces
        an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and
        stored in a video file for subsequent display or processing.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The result with photographic emulsion is a series
        of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are later chemically "developed"
        into a visible image.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The images on the film stock are played back
        at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen, creating the illusion of motion.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science
        and business as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

        Cinematography __knowledge__ The word "cinematography" was created from the
        Greek words ("kinema"), meaning "movement, motion" and ("graphein") meaning
        "to record", together meaning "recording motion."

        Digital camera __knowledge__ A digital camera or digicam is a camera that
        captures photographs in digital memory.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ Most cameras produced today are digital, and
        while there are still dedicated compact cameras on the market, the use of
        dedicated digital cameras is dwindling, as digital cameras are now incorporated
        into many devices ranging from mobile devices to vehicles.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ However, expensive, high-end, high-definition
        dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ Digital and movie cameras share an optical system,
        typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image
        pickup device.

        Digital camera __knowledge__ The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount
        of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic
        rather than chemical.

        Digital camera back __knowledge__ A digital camera back is a device that attaches
        to the back of a camera in place of the traditional negative film holder and
        contains an electronic image sensor.

        Digital camera back __knowledge__ This lets cameras that were designed to
        use film take digital photographs.

        Digital camera back __knowledge__ These camera backs are generally expensive
        by consumer standards (US$5000 and up) and are primarily built to be attached
        on medium- and large-format cameras used by professional photographers.

        Digital camera back __knowledge__ Two sensor back types are commonly used:
        single shot back (non-scanning) and scan back.

        Digital camera back __knowledge__ Some backs, primarily older ones, require
        multiple exposures to capture an image; generally one each for red, green,
        and blue.

        Digital photography __knowledge__ Digital photography is a form of photography
        that uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture
        images focused by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic film.

        Digital photography __knowledge__ The captured images are digitized and stored
        as a computer file ready for further digital processing, viewing, digital
        publishing or printing.

        Digital photography __knowledge__ Until the advent of such technology, photographs
        were made by exposing light sensitive photographic film and paper, which was
        processed in liquid chemical solutions to develop and stabilize the image.

        Digital photography __knowledge__ Digital photographs are typically created
        solely by computer-based photoelectric and mechanical techniques, without
        wet bath chemical processing.

        History of the camera __knowledge__ The history of the camera can be traced
        much further back than the introduction of photography.

        History of the camera __knowledge__ Cameras evolved from the camera obscura,
        and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology,
        including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and to the modern day
        with digital cameras.

        History of the camera __knowledge__ The forerunner to the photographic camera
        was the "camera obscura".

        History of the camera __knowledge__ Camera obscura (Latin for "dark room")
        is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at
        the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a
        small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside
        down) on a surface opposite to the opening.

        Camera __knowledge__ A camera is an optical instrument for recording or capturing
        images, which may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both.

        Camera __knowledge__ The images may be individual still photographs or sequences
        of images constituting videos or movies.

        Camera __knowledge__ The camera is a remote sensing device as it senses subjects
        without any contact  .

        Camera __knowledge__ The word "camera" comes from "camera obscura", which
        means "dark chamber" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting
        an image of external reality onto a flat surface.

        Camera __knowledge__ The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera
        obscura.

        Camera __knowledge__ The functioning of the camera is very similar to the
        functioning of the human eye.

        IMAX __knowledge__ IMAX is a 70 mm motion picture film format that displays
        images of greater size and resolution than conventional film systems.

        IMAX __knowledge__ Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William
        C. Shaw developed the IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and
        early 1970s in Canada.

        IMAX __knowledge__ Unlike conventional projectors, the film runs horizontally
        (see diagram sprocket holes) so that the image width is greater than the width
        of the film.

        IMAX __knowledge__ Since 2002, some feature films have been converted into
        IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres, and some have also been partially
        shot in IMAX.

        IMAX __knowledge__ IMAX is the most widely used system for special-venue film
        presentations.

        Ritz Dakota Digital __knowledge__ The Ritz Dakota Digital is a type of point-and-shoot
        digital camera, introduced in July of 2003, and sold by the Ritz Camera Centers.

        Ritz Dakota Digital __knowledge__ It has a digital photo resolution of 1.2
        megapixels (1280 pixels wide, 960 pixels high) and a storage capacity of 25
        pictures.

        Ritz Dakota Digital __knowledge__ When introduced, the Dakota Digital sparked
        massive interest, primarily due to its price tag: $10.99 (US Dollars).

        Ritz Dakota Digital __knowledge__ At the time, a digital camera of similar
        resolution and functionality was in the $40–$70 range.

        Ritz Dakota Digital __knowledge__ The reason for the low price was because
        the Dakota Digital was a "single-use camera", i.e.

        Ritz Dakota Digital __knowledge__ the consumer takes the pictures, returns
        the camera to the store, and the pictures are returned to the consumer in
        print and CD-ROM format (after an additional $11 processing fee) while the
        camera is refurbished and resold.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera __knowledge__ A digital single-lens reflex
        camera (also called a digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera that combines
        the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital
        imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera __knowledge__ The reflex design scheme is
        the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera __knowledge__ In the reflex design, light
        travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image
        to either the viewfinder or the image sensor.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera __knowledge__ The traditional alternative
        would be to have a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term "single lens"
        for this design.

        Digital single-lens reflex camera __knowledge__ By using only one lens, the
        viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially
        from what is captured by the camera''s sensor.
