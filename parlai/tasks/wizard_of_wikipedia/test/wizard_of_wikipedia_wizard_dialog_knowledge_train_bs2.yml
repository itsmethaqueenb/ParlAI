        Soft drink A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that
        typically contains carbonated water (although lemonade, among others, is usually
        not carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.

        Soft drink The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice,
        sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these.

        Soft drink Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives,
        and other ingredients.

        Soft drink Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic
        beverages.

        Soft drink Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the
        alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume if the drink is
        to be considered non-alcoholic.

        Sugary drink tax A sugary drink tax or soda tax is a tax or surcharge designed
        to reduce consumption of drinks with added sugar.

        Sugary drink tax Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated
        soft drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks.

        Sugary drink tax The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and
        beverage producers like Coca-Cola often oppose it.

        Sugary drink tax Advocates such as national medical associations and the World
        Health Organization (WHO) promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation,
        aimed to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs
        of obesity.

        Sugary drink tax Type II Diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed
        and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly
        due to type II diabetes in 2015 alone.

        Diet drink Diet (alternatively marketed as sugar-free, zero-calorie or low-calorie)
        drinks are sugar-free, artificially sweetened versions of fizzy beverages
        with virtually no calories.

        Diet drink They are generally marketed toward health-conscious people, diabetics,
        athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness,
        or reduce their sugar intake.

        Diet drink The beginning of the diet drink or refreshment era was in 1952,
        when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar-free ginger ale
        called No-Cal.

        Diet drink It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained
        local.

        Diet drink Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper
        in 1958 announcing a diet product, Diet Rite.

        Energy drink An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs,
        usually including caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical
        stimulation (marketed as "energy", but distinct from food energy).

        Energy drink They may or may not be carbonated and many also contain sugar
        or other sweeteners, herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids.

        Energy drink They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which
        includes bars and gels, and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised
        to enhance sports performance.

        Energy drink There are many brands and varieties of energy drinks.

        Energy drink Coffee, tea and other naturally caffeinated beverages are usually
        not considered energy drinks.

        Benzene in soft drinks Benzene in soft drinks is of potential concern due
        to the carcinogenic nature of the benzene molecule.

        Benzene in soft drinks This contamination is a public health concern and has
        caused significant outcry among environmental and health advocates.

        Benzene in soft drinks Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally
        and internationally, and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally
        in soft drinks.

        Benzene in soft drinks The benzene forms from decarboxylation of the preservative
        benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron
        and copper) that act as catalysts, especially under heat and light.

        Benzene in soft drinks The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation
        of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic
        acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315).

        Container deposit legislation Container-deposit legislation (also known as
        a deposit-refund scheme, bottle bill, or deposit-return system) is any law
        that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers
        (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale.

        Container deposit legislation When the container is returned to an authorized
        redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly
        or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser).

        Container deposit legislation It is a deposit-refund system.

        Container deposit legislation Governments may pass container deposit legislation
        for several reasons, including, for example:  Deposits that are not redeemed
        are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system
        (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect,
        sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity
        involved to fund environmental programs.

        is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity
        and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its

        known as "the new taste of Coca-Cola" until 1992, when it was renamed Coke
        Ⅱ.  Coca-Cola''s market share had been losing ground to diet soft drinks and
        non-cola beverages for many years.
