      The drink was created in the 1880s by pharmacist Charles Alderton in Waco, Texas
      and first served around 1885. Dr Pepper was first nationally marketed in the
      United States in 1904, and is now also sold in Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico,
      Australia, and South America, as well as New Zealand and South Africa as an
      imported good. Variants include a version without high fructose corn syrup,
      Diet Dr Pepper, as well as a line of additional flavors, first introduced in
      the 2000s. The U.S. Patent Office recognizes December 1, 1885, as the first
      time Dr Pepper was served. It was introduced nationally in the United States
      at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition as a new kind of soda pop, made with
      23 flavors. Its introduction in 1885 preceded the introduction of Coca-Cola
      by one year. It was formulated by Brooklyn-born pharmacist Charles Alderton
      in Morrison''s Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas. To test his new drink,
      he first offered it to store owner Wade Morrison, who also found it to his liking.
      Patrons at Morrison''s soda fountain soon learned of Alderton''s new drink and
      began ordering a "Waco". Alderton gave the formula to Morrison, who named it
      Dr. Pepper (later stylized as "Dr Pepper").

    text: 'The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in
      Toronto, Ontario. The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association
      (NBA), as a member club of the league''s Eastern Conference Atlantic Division.
      The team was established in 1995, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, as part
      of the NBA''s expansion into Canada. When the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis,
      Tennessee to become the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, the Raptors became the only
      Canadian-based team in the NBA. They originally played their home games at SkyDome,
      before moving eastward along Bremner Boulevard to the Air Canada Centre in 1999.
      Like most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after
      the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade in 1998, the team
      set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002.
      Carter was instrumental in leading the team to a then-franchise high 47 wins
      and their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern
      Conference semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to
      make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.
      After Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader.
