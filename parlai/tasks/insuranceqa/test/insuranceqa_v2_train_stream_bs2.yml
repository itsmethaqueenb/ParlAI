      - 'Not generally . There are five states that require most all employers carry
        short term disability insurance on their employees . These states are : California
        , Hawaii , New Jersey , New York , and Rhode Island . Besides this mandatory
        short term disability law , there is no other legislative imperative for someone
        to purchase or be covered by disability insurance .'
      - Life insurance unlike health insurance is not required by law . There are
        scenarios where life insurance can be required such as a loan institution
        requiring you to carry a life insurance policy large enough to cover the debt
        in case of death . There are scenarios in court cases such as a divorce where
        life insurance is court ordered to cover alimony or child support . But over
        all unlike health insurance on the federal side of the law and car insurance
        on the state side of the law , life insurance is not required by law .
      - 'There are five states that have mandatory disability insurance laws . These
        states are : California , Hawaii , New Jersey , New York , and Rhode Island
        . The exact provisions of these mandatory disability insurance laws varies
        by state . You can obtain additional specific information about your state
        ''s mandatory disability insurance law by checking with the states department
        of insurance -LRB- aka insurance commissioner ''s office -RRB- .'
      - Unlike auto insurance Homeowners insurance is not required by any law . However
        , that does n't mean that you 're not required to carry it . I know that sounds
        contradictory , but there 's a significant distinction . Even though you 're
        not required by law to carry it , you may be required by contract , namely
        a mortgage , to carry at least a minimum of coverage . When you purchase a
        home with a mortgage , the mortgage company will require you to carry coverage
        that will repair or rebuild your home to certain standards . The mortgage
        company is simply protecting the asset you 're using as collateral for the
        loan . If you own your home outright , you not required to insure it at all
        . Why someone would n't protect their biggest asset is a mystery to me , but
        it could happen . Be smart . find an agent you can trust . He/she will be
        able to help you get the coverage you need at a price you can afford .
      - That is really a question for lawyer or a law enforcement officer . I would
        say though that if the state that you reside in a state that requires every
        driver to have auto insurance coverage then I believe it would be a crime
        . If your state requires all drivers to have auto insurance coverage and you
        are stopped by a law enforcement officer and found not to have the required
        coverage I believe you could incur penalties imposed by the laws within that
        state .
      - I do not know of any state law that requires that one have Renters Insurance
        . Certainly it is not the law of the State of Connecticut . However , the
        law does not prohibit a property owner from requiring that their tenants carry
        renters insurance . Talk to your insurance professional about your needs and
        seriously consider renters insurance for your own protection and peace of
        mind .
      - No , the requirement to have and maintain car insurance is not a Federal Law
        , it is however , State Law in most , if not all states now . Insurance is
        regulated by each state 's Insurance Department and the requirement to have
        car insurance is a state law that is managed and regulated by each State 's
        Department of Motor Vehicles .
      - There is no law that requires a US citizen to purchase life insurance like
        the new ACA law that requires all US citizens purchase health insurance ,
        There are situations where life insurance can be required such as court ordered
        due to a divorce or child custody case or even adoptions . Also lenders such
        as mortgage companies can require a person to purchase life insurance to secure
        a large debt .
      - The important factors that will play a large role in both the cost of a DI
        policy and how meaningful the benefit will be to a individual are ; The benefit
        amount , the elimination period , the duration of the benefit period , and
        the way in which the policy defines a disability . The benefit amount , the
        recurring monthly income your disability policy pays you while you are injured
        , represents the most important aspect of the coverage . Laws in most states
        limit disability insurance benefits to two-thirds of your current gross income
        . While most people select the maximum available benefit , you can choose
        lower amounts if your personal cash reserves are sufficient to supplement
        disability income payments . After you meet the criteria and are eligible
        to begin receiving income from your disability insurance policy , the length
        of time you must wait before payments begin is called the elimination period
        . Most major insurance carriers offer the same standard elimination periods
        ranging from one month to one year . Longer periods result in lower policy
        premiums . Once you begin receiving payments from your disability policy ,
        they will continue until you are no longer disabled or your benefits have
        been exhausted . Disability insurance policies with maximum benefit periods
        of two years or less are classified as short-term disability products . If
        you own a short-term policy , payments will continue every month but will
        cease after two consecutive years . Policies with maximum benefit periods
        beyond two years are classified as long-term disability products . The most
        common benefit period choices for long-term policies are three years , five
        years , ten years or until age 65 . Every insurance company has its own formal
        definition of a disability , and benefit payments will not start unless your
        status falls within these guidelines . Some companies define disability as
        an inability to perform any gainful income-producing work at all . Collecting
        benefits under policies purchased from these carriers often presents a significant
        challenge . Thankfully , a large percentage of carriers consider you disabled
        if you are unable to perform the substantial duties of your own current employment
        position , a policy feature commonly referred to as `` own occupation . ''
        If your injury prevents you from adequately fulfilling the requirements of
        your current job , you are eligible to begin collecting benefits after the
        expiry of the elimination period .
      - Under the mental health parity requirements of Federal law -LRB- Mental Health
        Parity and Addiction Act of 2008 -RRB- and later of ObamaCare , major medical
        plans must now cover mental health issues the same as they would treat any
        other medical condition . So , any financial requirements such as copays ,
        deductibles or any treatment limitations -LRB- such as number of visits -RRB-
        can be no more restrictive for mental health or addiction than for a physical
        ailment . An important distinction that the reader should be aware of is that
        the 2008 law applied to employers with 50 or more employees . Under the requirements
        of the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- this was extended to individual
        and small group policies sold on or after January 1 , 2014 . It is possible
        that there are existing `` grandfathered '' policies still in effect that
        are not subject to these requirements though such policies are becoming fewer
        and fewer .
      - You can not legally take out a life insurance policy on your son without his
        knowledge , if your son is an adult . The law dictates that adults have the
        right to know of , and to consent to , life insurance policies out on their
        lives . But would your son object to you taking out a policy on him ? Accidental
        death policies do not need any medical requirements , and he could get life
        insurance that would not require an exam .
      - Homeonwers insurance to best of my knowledge is not required by law within
        the United States . Your mortgage lender will normally require you to carry
        homeowners insurance in order to protect there investment . If you did not
        have homeowners insurance and were to experience a major loss this more than
        likelywould lessen your capacity to repay you debt to the lender and the property
        that was used as collateral would more than likely be lesser or non existant
        .
      - Life Insurance companies are formed under state laws . Each law regulates
        the activities of the insurance companies that are admitted to that state
        . The company offers to provide a guaranteed amount to a customer whose death
        falls within a certain period of time . This period of time can be a lifetime
        . Companies market their product in various ways ; however , the product is
        sufficiently complex that most people seek the advice and assistance of a
        state licensed insurance agent .
      - This is more of a family law question than a question that can be answered
        by life insurance professionals . You should contact an attorney with family
        law experience for advice . It is not unusual for divorce decrees to address
        and give direction with respect to how life insurance is to be handled .
      - The simple answer to this is the high cost of health care and prescription
        drugs . Insurance companies are forced to maintain a very small profit margin
        by law , and any rate increases must be approved by the Department of Insurance
        . The PPACA laws are going to make the situation worse for many , unfortunately
        .
      - The Supreme Court has ruled that the Affordable Care Act is a tax law . Under
        that law you can be fined if you do not have health insurance . There is an
        implementation schedule and dates have shifted recently . The idea was to
        make sure everyone had health insurance so I suspect that there will certainly
        be pressure on everyone to have a policy .
      - It depends on your policy and the circumstances . Rental is something you
        can add to your auto policy . It is designed to provide you with a rental
        car if you are involved in an at fault accident . If the accident is the fault
        of the other driver then generally his insurance would cover the rental .
        Keep in mind insurance laws differ in many states . Some states are what is
        called no-fault . This means that neither driver is considered at fault in
        the event of an accident and each drivers insurance would pay for their own
        insured . Check with you agent to make sure of the laws in your state .
      - The 1st thing you need to think about is what you can afford for the cost
        of insurance and also what can you afford to loose id you have inadequate
        coverage . Each state varies for the amount of liability that you are required
        to have . In Montana the limits are 25K per person -LRB- medical payment to
        others -RRB- 50K per accident and 10K for property damage which if you think
        about it that is not much coverage in the event of a major accident . Then
        you need to take in the factor of uninsured and underinsured both are fairly
        inexpensive and well worth the few dollars it is a month here in our state
        1 in 3 cars has no insurances your odds of an accident and getting hit by
        someone with no insurance is high . Laws in most states require you to have
        the state minimum . I recommend the higher limits then what state requirements
        are however . You also have a budget in mind It does no good to buy a policy
        with higher limits if you can not afford the monthly payment . So it really
        depends on what you can afford to loose and what fits your monthly budget.I
        recommend talking to a local agent and seeing what they have for rates as
        a independent agent can compare rates with many carriers and can help you
        muddle through the confusion .
      - This can be different state by state , but I can advise regarding Connecticut
        . If you let your car insurance lapse here , a couple of things will occur
        . First , because the CT Department of Motor Vehicles requires by law that
        anyone who registers a car here must have and maintain car insurance , such
        a lapse can cause you serious problems down the line . Here , insurance companies
        and DMV share information so when a policy lapses , DMV is notified by your
        insurance company . DMV will send a letter requiring you to provide proof
        that coverage was maintained and if you can not provide such proof , regardless
        ofhow long the lapse , you will be fairly heavily fined . Secondly , when
        you do decide to establish car insurance again , you may find that it will
        cost you more than it did before the lapse . This is because companies have
        underwriting requirements that stipulate that one must maintain continuous
        coverage for at least the previous 6 monthsin order to qualify for standard
        rating . If that can not be proven , you will end up with a higher risk carrier
        for at least 6 months and will pay a much higher premium that you have been
        used to paying .
      - 'The answer to this question depends on the laws of the state you are from
        . If you plan non operating -LRB- PNO -RRB- and renew car registration with
        PNO fee you do n''t have to have insurance on it . The only requirement that
        insurance company may have is that your car is properly registered with DMV
        . For instance , if the car is salvaged and there is no title , you ca n''t
        insure it . But if the title was issued - you can get coverage . Here is a
        tricky question : if you own an off road mobile equipment , for instance ,
        the one used in construction , and this vehicle is not designed / nor used
        on public roads - you are not required to register -LRB- i.e. forklift -RRB-
        . But if you cross a highway on a public road , than this creates a legal
        issue . This is a known fact . In the end , to answer your question more info
        is required . Do n''t relay on anything you read here .'

      - One of the insurance carriers I represent is Travelers and yes , you can purchase
        Renters insurance through Travelers . I would look for a local agent who can
        assist you in placing a renters policy if you are interested . I am sure the
        local agent would be happy to quote Travelers if they have access and other
        carries as well .

      - In order to cancel Travelers renters insurance policy you would either contact
        your Travelers agent or Travelers directly to notify them of your request
        to cancel your renters policy . Most likely you will be asked to provide a
        letter in writing that is dated and signed to process the cancellation request
        .
      - -- > Normal 0 While I have no intention to question a colleague , Im not sure
        I would place a Travelers Tenants policy in the Excellent column , good ,
        maybe , but certainly not excellent . The Travelers tenant homeowners policy
        covers your personal property but limits that coverage to specific named perils
        . In my opinion , an excellent tenant homeowners policy would cover any direct
        damage -LRB- except for specific exclusions and limitations -RRB- . The basic
        Travelers tenants policy covers the insured for the Actual Cash Value of their
        property . An excellent policy would cover the full replacement cost of covered
        property , new for old . The Travelers tenant homeowners policy , like many
        others , covers your personal property but limits theft coverage on Jewelry
        , Furs or Silver to , I believe , $ 1000 . An excellent policy would have
        either no limitations or the limits would be no less than $ 5000 in the aggregate
        for each category . The Travelers liability coverage excludes , as do most
        other tenants policies , property damage to property in the insureds care
        , custody or control . Generally that would include property damage to the
        apartment you are living in . This exclusion would not apply to Fire or Smoke
        damage but I dont believe water damage to the apartment you rent would be
        covered by the basic policy . Securing coverage for accidental damage to the
        apartment they are living in may be a very important coverage for most apartment
        renters . Obtaining a waiver from your landlord for any damage covered by
        the landlords insurance may be the best and most economical alternative .
        If buying coverage on-line or face to face from a local broker , I suggest
        these questions be raised and addressed .
      - To determine the value of a travel insurance policy review the coverage that
        you currently have . Some people have coverage that extends to the locality
        where they live , or the state in which they reside . Coverage outside of
        that specified area can be highly limited . The issue becomes more severe
        with most plans when you travel overseas . If your current coverage is inadequate
        to cover potential difficulties secure a travel insurance policy . Personally
        , I travel overseas frequently and never purchase travel insurance .
      - Most health insurance plans give some coverage overseas . The extent of the
        coverage in most cases is determined by looking at the event as life threatening.If
        that is the case , then emergency room visits would be covered.What is important
        for the traveler to know is that most doctors and hospitals in foreign countries
        want payment up front for services at the time of the visit . One instance
        I know of that happened to a traveler in Panama was a traveler went to the
        hospital and was required to pay $ 5,000 up front as a deposit before they
        would treat them . The traveler has to file claims after the fact and wait
        for a reimbursement . If you are covered by Medicaid or Medicare , there is
        no coverage outside the U.S. except Medicare will cover emergencies in Canada
        if they happen while en route to Alaska . When traveling outside the U.S.
        and on cruises the best course of action is to purchase a medical policy specifically
        for coverage overseas . These policies are very economical and offer an array
        of terms and choices . One of the most important services is to have a multilingual
        customer service agent who can help you locate medical services , deal with
        currency exchanges , manage claims and can co-ordinate services 24/7 . There
        are many companies that provide these insurance policies . I represent International
        Medical Group -LRB- IMG -RRB- who has many choices for nationals and foreign
        nationals that travel globally for business or pleasure . They have been in
        business for over twenty years and concentrate solely on this market . The
        United States Consular Bureau of Affairs also has a list of companies that
        provide these policies .
      - Renter 's dwelling insurance or rental dwelling insurance ? Renters insurance
        , or dwelling insurance ? There are two directions to travel on this question
        . First , renters insurance is coverage for a non-owner occupant of an apartment
        or residential dwelling . We often use the term `` tenant '' or `` renter
        '' to describe this person or family . Since the tenant does n't own the structures
        the primary objective under a tenant or renters policy is to cover their personal
        property , additional living expenses after a loss we insure , and personal
        liability . A Renters Insurance Policy -LRB- Or Tenant Insurance Policy -RRB-
        is one of the various forms of Homeowner Insurance that has been modified
        to reflect the unique needs of a non-owner occupant of residential property
        . Rental dwelling insurance is coverage purchased by the owner of the residential
        dwelling to protect their interest in an apartment or dwelling occupied by
        someone else . It is n't required that the property be non-owner occupied
        under such dwelling policies , but typically , this is the case since most
        homeowners insurance policies afford a much better coverage and premium value
        than a dwelling policy . Dwelling policies can be used in a number of circumstances
        from those where the owner occupies the property , to those where a non-owner
        occupant resides in the home . A dwelling type policy is frequently used to
        provide coverage for a dwelling in the `` course of construction '' or when
        it is undergoing significant renovation . When used in this way it is not
        uncommon for the policy to be referred to as `` builders risk '' insurance
        . This type of policy is sold to the owners of property and not to builders
        . Builders can obtain coverage for their exposures to loss in these cases
        from a commercial liability and property policy they maintain for their operations
        . The builder would have only a financial interest in the property to the
        extent of their unpaid work and material so some form of policy coverage or
        endorsement that extends the value of property and services they have installed
        in such a dwelling would be the best method of providing coverage . After
        all , we always have to be concerned with the `` insurable interest '' and
        the only one with a true interest to the totality of loss would be the property
        owner and not a builder or contractor .
      - Travelers Insurance Company has an excellent renters insurance policy . The
        Form HO-4 covers Personal Property and Personal Liability Insurance for the
        tenant -LRB- insured -RRB- . Renters Insurance is a very valuable coverage
        because it no only offers protection against damage to your personal property
        but also protection against negligence and personal liability cases that may
        be brought against you . One valuable example is if there is fire , smoke
        or water damage to the rented home or apartment unit , the property owner
        's insurance company will most likely attempt to collect damages from the
        tenant if they can prove negligence . In this case , Renters Insurance will
        provide the legal representation to handle the situation although the policy
        limit will apply . If you are not sure and do n't really want to commit to
        purchase renters insurance but may or may not be required to according to
        your lease agreement , the best way to generate the lowest annual premium
        is to select the minimum personal property coverage available , the lowest
        limit of personal liability and the highest available deductible for the policy
        . There is a link providing an online format to obtain a quote and buy renters

      - I am going to make a different assumption from Julie on this and go with a
        travel MEDICAL insurance plan vs. auto . Travel medical insurance is designed
        to supplement your major medical or Medicare plan when you travel outside
        the United States . Most major medical plans have worldwide coverage but there
        are some expenses that are not covered by major medical . These would include
        med evac , translation of medical records and return of mortal remains . Some
        Medicare Advantage plans have out of country coverage but if you have original
        Medicare your out of country coverage is limited . It would be wise to purchase
        an international travel medical plan .
      - Travelers is often used to describe Travelers Indemnity Company . That company
        does not offer life insurance . However , Travelers Life and Annuity is a
        company that used to sell Life Insurance , and was acquired by the MetLife
        Life and Annuity Company of Connecticut in 2005 .

      - 'The simple answer is : you should pay an amount that you can afford . People
        who buy life insurance with the last dollar in their monthly budget will end
        up dropping their policy when emergencies arise . Life insurance that is dropped
        is of no value at all . Setting aside an affordable amount to pay life insurance
        premiums will help ensure that your policy is active when needed . Also ,
        many people feel that if they ca n''t buy a large amount of life insurance
        , they will buy none at all . Who among us would not welcome an extra $ 10,000
        of cash at the traumatic time of losing a loved one and trying to take time
        off work , arrange for a funeral , house relatives or travel to the location
        of the funeral ? It does not take a million dollar policy to show love for
        those who are left behind . Of course , premiums differ for different types
        of policies and different types of risk . If you are using your life insurance
        to provide income during retirement , it will take a much larger portion of
        your budget than if you are just funding your funeral . Also , life insurance
        for those who are older or of poorer health will cost more than life insurance
        for young , healthy persons . But there is also a greater chance of the death
        benefit being paid out sooner when the insured person is older or suffers
        from poor health . A licensed agent can help you look at your whole financial
        picture and pick out a policy that will meet your needs at an affordable cost
        .'
      - The majority of life insurance denials are a result of something found in
        the paramedical exam from the applicant ` sblood orurine testor medical history
        that is outside the life insurance company 's standards . These `` standards
        '' can vary a bit from one company to the next . The insurance company is
        all about `` risk '' and if they see something they believe is significant
        , they may deny coverage . Another option they have is to `` rate '' the individual
        below what they call `` standard '' and that move by them would make the cost
        of insurance more expensive for the applicant because the insurance company
        sees that individual as a higher risk . There areother reasons as well which
        include driving record -LRB- 2 DUI 's can be trouble here -RRB- , repeated
        risky activities such as travel to what they consider dangerous destinations
        in the world , non-sanctioned vehicle racing -LRB- cars , motorcycles , etc
        -RRB- and others . One of the best ways to help avoid a denial of life insurance
        coverage is to work with a knowledgeable life insurance agent who , based
        on your complete medical history disclosed in advance of the application ,
        will help determine which life insurance company could be the most forgiving
        for your particular situation . The underwriting process for life insurance
        can be appealed and if you are working with a knowledgeable agent , they may
        be able to help get the denial reversed .
      - An auto dealership will most likely carry the insurance required to allow
        test drives . In the event of a loss/accident , the claim would fall back
        onto the insurance of the dealership . Consequently , if the insurance company
        is able to prove negligence on behalf of the driver , they may very well turn
        around and subrogate against the driver for the damages . As for personal
        auto policies , insurance will travel with the vehicle in most circumstances
        . If you are a private-seller it would be wise to check with your insurance
        agent prior to letting anyone drive your vehicle . The wording in auto policies
        can vary greatly from company to company and it is always best to err on the
        side of caution when dealing with insurance .
      - 'There are a variety of reasons why life insurance would be denied to a potential
        insured applying for coverage : Medical issues , no financial justification
        , the recreational activities are too dangerous , there is no insurable interest
        , the travel destination during the next two years is too dangerous , the
        driving record is too egregious , drug abuse , vocation hazard , etc. . There
        are reasons that a death claim would be denied like fraud or suicide in the
        first two years . In the first two years after the policy has been kept in
        force there is a contestability period for suicide , misrepresentation and
        fraud . Keep in mind that certain life insurance companys death claim due
        diligence processes may continue after the two year contestability period
        based on some forms of fraud and criminal activity surrendering the insureds
        death . If it feasible that a life insurance company to experience financial
        problems , fall into receivership of the state -LRB- a form of bankruptcy
        -RRB- and affect claims paying ability .'
      - High risk life insurance is coverage issued to persons who have a risk of
        passing away at a younger age than the general population . None of the policies
        I sell classify high risk based on occupation . A corrections officer can
        get the same rate as a business owner , as long as their health is the same
        . Some high risk policies cater to those who are overweight . Some target
        certain health conditions . Some are more favorable than other companies for
        those who have gone through treatment for substance abuse , regularly travel
        to foreign countries , participate in dangerous hobbies , or have unstable
        finances . To find the policy that best suits your particular kind of high
        risk , contact an impaired risk specialist such as myself . We have access
        to many different companies and can match you up with the one that is most
        lenient with your unique risk factors .
      - If you have a PPO health insurance plan you have in-network benefits as well
        as out-of-network benefits . This means that if you are traveling out of your
        home state you will have benefits which are most likely out-of-network benefits
        . Out-of-networks benefits are less than in-network benefits . For example
        your deductible may be $ 500 in-network and $ 1,000 out-of-network . In addition
        your co-insurance might be 20 % in-network but 50 % out of network . The annual
        out-of-pocket maximum would be higher also .
      - HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization . When you are in an HMO you
        must stay in a network of doctors and health care providers , otherwise you
        are not covered unless you have an emergency . When selecting your Medicare
        Advantage Plan it is crucial that you make sure your doctors and hospitals
        are in your network . Also if you travel outside of your area for a few months
        out of the year , many Ohio residents have homes in Florida , for example
        and live in Florida during the winter , make sure your plan has a program
        that will allow you move your network to that state . United Healthcare and
        Aetna have such programs .
      - Most states require proof of car insurance in order to register your car for
        use on public roads and highways . So , if you reside in one state and have
        a car registered there , then the insurance would have to be issued from that
        state as well . Check with your Insurance Professional about the terms and
        conditions of your policy , but generally , the coverage you have in your
        policy will protect you across state lines , and into Canada . There may be
        limitations on travel to Mexico . Now , there may be other factors to consider
        as well . Here in CT , once one establishes residency , one has 30 days in
        order to register their car here . In order to register a car here , a CT
        issued Insurance policy will be required .

      - If the person who passed away was the one with the debt , creditors generally
        can not take the life insurance proceeds left as long as the beneficiary was
        a person . The money then belongs to that beneficiary , and as long as creditors
        do not have a claim against the beneficiary , they can not take life insurance
        proceeds from them .
      - Creditors can not go after the life insurance payout to pay the debts of the
        deceased insured person , as long as the beneficiary or beneficiaries who
        are receiving the life insurance proceeds are actual people . Life insurance
        bypasses probate , so the creditor does not have the opportunity to access
        the life insurance payout . If the beneficiary is the insured person 's estate
        , the creditors may be able to go after the life insurance death benefit to
        pay the debts of the insured . If the beneficiary is the one who has the debts
        , then the creditors can go after the life insurance payout . This is also
        true if the beneficiary shared a debt with the deceased .
      - Creditors can go after life insurance proceeds that are left to the estate
        . Probate is the process of administering an estate , and when the death benefit
        from life insurance is left to the estate , those funds are in the pool ,
        and during probate , creditors will go after their share . If life insurance
        is left to a person as a beneficiary , that person who collects the money
        is not generally liable for paying the debts of the person who died . State
        laws differ and there are variations that can affect this , but the general
        rule is that creditors for the deceased can not go after the life insurance
        the deceased person left to you .
      - If the creditor is going after life insurance proceeds that have been left
        to the insured person 's estate , and is doing so to pay off bills left by
        the deceased , then the creditor can claim life insurance benefits during
        probate . If the beneficiary of the life insurance policy is a person , then
        creditors can not take the death benefit away from the beneficiary . There
        may be some exceptions , such as if the beneficiary was a co-signer to the
        debt .
      - The answer to this questions depends on a few specifics . In many states ,
        a creditor can not take the cash values of a life insurance policy from a
        policy owner -LRB- this is not true of all states , however -RRB- . For death
        benefit , as long as the death benefit is paid to a beneficiary who is not
        a party to the loan for which the creditor is trying to collect money , the
        creditor would not be able to take life insurance proceeds , unless those
        proceeds were paid to the policy owner 's estate , at which point in time
        they would need to be distributed through the probate process , and the creditor
        would have the ability to file claim against the estate in an attempt to recover
        monies owed .
      - If the creditor is going after money owed by the insured person who passed
        away , the life insurance is exempt from creditors if the beneficiary of the
        policy was a person . Creditors can not take the life insurance proceeds from
        a beneficiary unless the beneficiary co-signed the debt with the insured person
        , or has debts of their own for which creditors are seeking payment .
      - Life insurance must be distributed to a beneficiary and not the estate to
        remain exempt from the deceaseds creditors . The beneficiaries creditors would
        be able to go after the life insurance proceeds . Most retirement accounts
        and cash value within a life insurance policy are exempt from creditors and
        can be retained , even through bankruptcy . One way creditors sometimes get
        to the funds is if life insurance proceeds are deposited into what was a joint
        checking account that the creditor had access to . While a person may be able
        to have the funds returned through legal proceedings , it is often best to
        close the joint account and open a new account .
      - If you mean can creditors , rather than debtors , take life insurance proceeds
        upon the death of the insured , they generally can not as long as the beneficiary
        of the policy is a person . If the beneficiary is the estate , creditors can
        go after the estate for payment of past debts on the part of the insured .
      - Life insurance that is left to a person as beneficiary is usually exempt from
        creditors in South Carolina . If the beneficiary has co-signed for an unpaid
        debt at the time the Insured dies , then the creditors may be able to go after
        the insurance proceeds . And if the beneficiary is the Insured 's estate ,
        creditors will try to collect their due from the insurance proceeds in the
        estate . But a person who receives a life insurance death benefit is not liable
        for the debts of the Insured .
      - If the person with the debt is the person who owes money to a creditor , then
        the creditor can take life insurance proceeds if they are left to his/her
        estate . If the beneficiary is a person , the creditor can not take the life
        insurance proceeds unless the beneficiary was a co-signer to the debt .
      - 'In Canada , variable annuities are usually called segregated funds or seg
        funds . They are similar to mutual funds , but since they are issued by insurance
        companies they have certain guarantees and features . If you are looking for
        an equity investment , then segregated funds should be considered . In today
        ''s marketplace there are a wide variety of plans available with very competitive
        costs . Segregated funds are suitable for self-employed business owners and
        professionals . In addition , individuals who want to invest in equities ,
        but would like maturity and death benefits guarantees . This is especially
        important if you are within 10 to 15 years of retirement or already retired
        . Segregated funds can offer : Death benefit guarantees of 100 % or 75 % Maturity
        guarantees of 100 % or 75 % Some plans offer the ability to reset or lock
        in market gains Potential creditor protection Estate planning advantages including
        avoiding probate which can save fees and provide privacy . If any of these
        are important to you then , you should consider segregated funds . More information
        is available at www.ProtectandGrow.ca If you have further questions , would

      - Life Insurance comes in many forms and is constantly evolving , but the bottom
        line is that Life Insurance should not be considered an investment product
        . There are types of contracts that build inside cash through variable interest
        rates or dividend structures or separate accounts , but these are side benefits
        to the most important reason to have life insurance . Life insurance provides
        some measure of financial security to your loved ones should you die too soon
        . That is it 's most important job . Keep in mind as well that Life Insurance
        proceeds pass directly to your beneficiary . They can not be attached by creditors
        nor are the direct proceeds taxable .
      - So long as there is a named beneficiary to receive the life insurance proceeds
        upon your death , those proceeds can not be attached or encumbered in any
        way by a creditor . The proceeds are also not taxable , though the interest
        or growth that invested proceeds generate are . Now , that having been said
        , if there is no beneficiary and the proceeds are paid therefore to your estate
        , as my colleague pointed out , once in the estate , they are fair game .
        Talk to your Insurance Professional regularly , perhaps once a year , to discuss
        any changes that may have happened in your life that can affect your Life
        Insurance . This is also a very good time to review your coverage to be sure
        it is what you need and that it is still accomplishing what it was indended
        to accomplish .
      - Provided that you have named a primarybeneficiary in your Life policy , then
        yes , the proceeds from that policy , upon your death , would pass directly
        to your beneficiary without any trouble from creditors . In addition to naming
        a beneficiary , it is also a very good idea to name a contingient beneficiary
        who would receive the proceeds if the primary benficiary can not , for some
        reason , receive them .
      - Life insurance proceeds paid to your named beneficiary are not attachable
        by creditors nor are they taxable . Your beneficiary is under no real obligation
        to use the proceeds to pay any of your debts , however , generally speaking
        , Life Insurance planning and the resulting policy protection is put into
        place to solve problems like this at the time of death . As an example , if
        you have a $ 250,000 mortgage , and you want your family to be able to stay
        in your home without that mortgage , then the proceeds can and rightfully
        should be used to pay off the loan , as that was your intent for your family
        's security .
      - If a person dies and has left no will , the estate must go through the probate
        process . This provides the beneficiaries , creditors and anyone else with
        a vested interest in the estate with a supervised place in which to distribute
        assets . Legal fees can make this a very expensive process . A life insurance
        policy is a contract that operates at the death of a person , However , the
        money is sent directly to the beneficiary . The risk is that the beneficiary
        might not be the intended beneficiary . This is a good reason to review your
        life insurance policy regularly .
      - 'In Canada , variable annuities are typically called segregated funds -LRB-
        separated from other assets of the insurance company -RRB- . They can only
        be sold by advisors licensed for life insurance . Segregated funds are similar
        to mutual funds but have special features including : Guarantees to protect
        your investment Potential creditor protection The right to name a beneficiary
        An information folder must be provided to the client before they buy . If
        you have further questions , or feel that I could be of assistance , please
        do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like to work with a local life
        insurance broker , you could start with a Google search . For example , if
        you search for : life insurance broker Halifax or life insurance agent Halifax
        , my name , along with several others , will come up . You can use the same
        method to find a life insurance broker in your community .'
      - If you were to die today , how long would your savings last ? How would your
        family pay the bills without your income ? Who will pay the debts you leave
        behind ? Life insurance provides the peace of mind and security in knowing
        that your loved ones will be able to continue on without you . They can stay
        in their home . Your child can go to college . Your final expenses will be
        taken care of . Even if you have a sizable estate , life insurance can be
        a means of helping to preserve that estate . It can hep make sure your business
        will continue until it can be sold . It can provide funds for a business partner
        to buy out your share of the business when you die . It avoids probate and
        creditors , unlike other savings vehicles . It provides an immediate estate
        . This is financial security !
      - Of course an irrevocable life insurance trust `` works '' for some things
        but not for other things . It depends what you are setting the trust up to
        do . One use is to pass money to beneficiaries and protect the funds from
        Medicaid or other creditors . If the trust is set up 5-years or more in advance
        , the money is protected by the trust and will pay to the beneficiaries upon
        your death .
      - For most of us who have been around for 25 years or more , the answer is yes
        . The life insurance industry is a great vocation . You never really understand
        your career until you deliver your first death claim to beneficiaries . The
        power of handing over a check to a widow when every other creditor is hovering
        over her is one of the greatest experiences youll ever have as an agent .
      labels:
      - If the person who passed away was the one with the debt , creditors generally

      - Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you
        have proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car . It is never a good
        idea to drive a car without insurance . If you traded a car in , then the
        coverage on the older car may extend to the new car temporarily , but you
        need to call your agent as soon as possible and get it changed . Most dealerships
        have an insurance agent they work with who can get you coverage as well .
      - Generally speaking , probably not . Most States require you to have at least
        a mandatory minimum amount of Liability Insurance in order for a car to be
        registered . Your Car Dealership will need to obtain proof of that coverage
        from your Isurance Professional in order to register the car for you , so
        without such proof , they ca n't really do anything to complete the deal .
        In addition , unless you are paying cash for the car , it will either be financed
        or leased and in both cases , there are requirements to have both Comprehensive
        and Collision coverage on the car and , in the case of a lease , the required
        amount of Liability coverage which is somewhat more than any State 's minimum
        requirement .
      - Probably not . Most states -LRB- including here in CT -RRB- require proof
        of insurance as a condition of registering your car . Dealerships will require
        that your insurance professional send them an Insurance Identification Card
        so that they can process the registration for you . Likewise , if you are
        either leasing or securing a loan to purchase your car , the financial institution
        will also require you to have the proper insurance coverage in place in order
        to finalize the sale .
      - If you have an existing auto insurance policy then you should be able to drive
        the new vehicle of the lot . You want to verify with your insurance provider
        your coverage 's . If you do not have any insurance in place do not drive
        the car anywhere until you have secured an insurance policy . Besides the
        fact you are required to have insurance to operate any motor-vehicle it would
        sure be a bummer to wreck your new car and have no coverage .
      - The answer you are looking for is no . You will not be able to take delivery
        of your newly purchased vehicle without proof of coverage for the vehicle
        . Proof of coverage is just one of the many documents that you will need to
        sign in order to complete the purchase of the vehicle to make it yours . Congratulations
        on your new vehicle !
      - DO N'T drive a new car home without insurance ! Always make sure you have
        active insurance before driving your car , especially a new car . If you lease
        or get a loan on a car the finance department usually will not let your drive
        off of the lot without proof of insurance . It depends on the state , but
        to my knowledge most states allow at least two weeks from the purchase of
        a new car for you to call your agent or carrier and update your vehicle information
        . During those two weeks the new vehicle -LRB- or newly purchased used vehicle
        -RRB- is typically considered covered . However , always update your vehicles
        with your agent or carrier asap !
      - I would like to add my two cents to this question , as Im not sure a couple
        of situations have been covered . But the question is Can I insure a car I
        dont own . If you own and insure a car , your own policy should extend your
        coverage to any car you are driving -LRB- borrowed , temporary substitute
        or short-term rental -RRB- as long as it is not another car you own or regularly
        use . In that sense , your policy then insures you driving a car you dont
        own . If you dont own a car but often drive cars you dont own and want to
        make sure you are adequately covered , you should be able to purchase a form
        of Drive Other Car coverage . Its common to see this coverage on business
        auto policies covering the business owner and family members when the business
        owner doesnt own a personal car but is provided vehicles by the company .
        Here again you are in a sense insuring a car you dont own . In my practice
        , I like to make sure every client has access to an automobile insuring agreement
        , as a named insured on a policy covering an owned car , as a spouse or family
        member residing in the household or some form of Drive Other Car coverage
        . I like to see adequate limits , comprehensive and collision and appropriate
        uninsured/underinsured coverage . No responsible adult should be without some
        form of auto insurance coverage ; as an owner , operator , passenger or pedestrian
        .
      - 'Driving without car insurance can have both legal and financial impacts upon
        your life . Caveat , this is geared towards Michigan drivers . Financially
        : if you get into a collision and are negligent , you could be sued for physical
        damages to the other driver/passengers . Without insurance you will be on
        the hook for the entire judgment against you . Furthermore , if you are driving
        a new car you will either be out the money you spent on the car , or you will
        owe the leasing company or lender the value of the car . Legal : in Michigan
        driving without proof of no-fault insurance can result in a $ 500 ticket and
        three points on your license . So you will be out $ 500 immediately , and
        a huge increase in your insurance upon renewal . This is assuming you will
        still have the same insurance and not get a non-renewal notice . I hope this
        helps .'
      - Like all other types of insurance , there is no one single price for home
        owners insurance , nor is there one company that is `` best '' or `` most
        affordable '' home owners coverage for everyone . To determine the best plan
        for your personal situation , I suggest speaking with a licensed insurance
        agent , one who represents many companies in your area . It is also important
        to note that the cost of your auto insurance can vary dramatically based on
        a number of factors , including where you live , what kind of car you drive
        , your personal driving record , and what type of coverage you want -LRB-
        minimum coverage to be legal to drive cost much less than a more comprehensive
        policy that provides far more coverage -RRB- . With property and casualty
        coverage such as home owners or auto insurance , you can normally get a better
        deal when purchasing coverage for more than one item . I have my car and my
        home both covered on policies with Auto-Owners Insurance company . With the
        multi-policy discounts I receive , I actually pay less to insure my home and
        car than I would pay to insure my home , if that was the only policy I carried
        with that company . While that may sound illogical , if not unbelievable ,
        it is true , and is a very smart approach to take to make sure you keep as
        much as your hard earned money in your pocket as possible .
      - Homeowners insurance is not always cheaper than car insurance . Insurance
        prices are based on the amount of risk an insurance company is taking , which
        is the reason costs vary so dramatically . Like all other types of insurance
        , there is no one single price for home owners insurance , nor is there one
        company that is `` best '' or `` most affordable '' coverage for everyone
        . To determine the best plan for your personal situation , I suggest speaking
        with a licensed insurance agent , one who represents many companies in your

        vary dramatically based on a number of factors , including where you live
        , what kind of car you drive , your personal driving record , and what type
        of coverage you want -LRB- minimum coverage to be legal to drive cost much
        less than a more comprehensive policy that provides far more coverage -RRB-
        . Likewise , the cost of your homeowners insurance can vary depending on the
        value of your home.With property and casualty coverage such as home owners
        or auto insurance , you can normally get a better deal when purchasing these
        two types of coverage from the same company . I have my car and my home both
        covered on policies with Auto-Owners Insurance company . With the multi-policy
        discounts I receive , I actually pay less to insure my home and car than I
        would pay to insure my home , if that was the only policy I carried with that
        company . While that may sound illogical , if not unbelievable , it is true
        , and is a very smart approach to take to make sure you keep as much as your
        hard earned money in your pocket as possible .
      - 'I am not a representative of State Farm as I am an independent agent . However
        , with that being said , State Farm can OFFER the ability to cover hail damage
        . Every insurance company that can protect your personal auto is able to provide
        coverage for hail damage . You are looking for a coverage called Other-than-collision
        -LRB- OTC -RRB- or sometimes called comprehensive coverage . This coverage
        is often called all-risk -LRB- a misnomer -RRB- or open-peril coverage . What
        the heck does that mean ? It means that comprehensive covers EVERYTHING to
        your auto UNLESS it says it will not cover it . This is actually very robust
        as a coverage because its impossible to list everything that can happen to
        a car for exclusions , so you can have coverage for the random things that
        happen to your car . If you look at your policy for OTC , nowhere does it
        mention that it will exclude -LRB- not cover -RRB- hail damage . This is good
        ; it means you can file a claim for OTC to repair hail damage to your auto
        . Here are a few things to understand about OTC with regards to hail damage
        : You have to pay your deductible for the repairs . Most often , this means
        that the insurance company will pay you all the money to get the car fixed
        EXCEPT for your deductible , which you then pay to the repair company that
        fixed you car . So if $ 3,000 worth of repairs was needed to fix your car
        from hail damage , and you have a $ 500 deductible , then the insurance company
        will give you $ 2500 -LRB- $ 3,000 - $ 500 deductible -RRB- so you can pay
        your $ 3,000 repair bill . The claim settlement might happen in another way
        , but the logic is still the same . Your OTC will pay the actual cash value
        of the car if the repairs are over a certain threshold -LRB- which is determined
        individually for each car -RRB- to make the car usable again . The company
        can literally scrap the car and pay you for it instead of repairing the hail
        damage . Keep this in mind for when determining if you want to file a claim
        as some cars arent worth much but could be in EXCELLENT condition for driving
        . You dont want to lose your car because you filed a claim for cosmetic damage
        , or keep the car and get a salvage title . Talk to your agent to make sure
        you have OTC . Make sure that the deductible is an amount you can afford to
        pay in a reasonable amount of time . Its no good to have a $ 500 , $ 1000
        , or $ 2,000 deductible for OTC if you can not get the money or put yourself
        in a poor financial position for 30 + days because of it . Sometimes paying
        the extra $ 5-10 per month for a lower deductible makes sense in households
        strapped for cash .'
      - Insurance Companies are trying to price a product before any one uses it and
        that is a difficult task So , things like deductibles as suggested here can
        limit your out of pocket expense in the short term , but maybe costly in the
        long run . So that is an important part of building a personal insurance program
        , but not necessarily a major piece . I never recommend reducing your limits
        . That is a drastic action and one you should avoid at all costs . For whatever
        reason you thought that was an adequate amount insurance before ; it is unlikely
        that your situation in life dictates that it no longer is necessary . Reduce
        your costs by how you drive . Many companies will give credit for substantially
        less driving . T he most correlated variable in auto insurance is actual mile
        s driven . So if you can reduce that , you should save on your auto policy
        . . Look at ride share , public transit or other ways to use your car less
        . If that is not practical look at ways you can drive safer . Be sure your
        air in your tires is correct , that you can safely see out of your side view
        mirrors , that you vision is good and that your attention to driving is foremost
        and that you are not impaired in any way including lack of sleep . Most accidents
        are caused by human error . Drive defensively !
      - This is a very hard questions to answer since each carrier from the next can
        vary so much . I have seen between different carriers as much as $ 1,000 difference
        for the same coverage . A classic example I will give one of my carriers that
        is a mutual carriers was only $ 1,000 a year with a $ 500 deductible based
        on a value of the home at $ 200,000 but the other national carrier was $ 1,400
        with a $ 1,000 deductible based off of the same value . Also you have to consider
        are they rating the home with replacement cost or actual cash value both can
        make a HUGE difference in the rating factor . There are several ways carriers
        base rates not only the value of the home but what is your home built from
        is it a log home or stick frame home . Are you in a fire area or how far are
        you away from fire department . The best thing you can do is shop with a independent
        agent they can rate it with many carriers . Also Bundling is not always the
        route either many time the home can be an excellent rate but the autos are
        high even with the discount of having both policies with the same carrier
        . Example I have found in our agency is that I have a carrier that gives you
        a discount on your auto because you own a home but the home rate is outrageous
        but then I have a different carrier for the home that does n't sell auto insurance
        but they give you a discount on the home if you insure the auto in the same
        agency and the rate is much lower then if you placed them with the same carrier
        all in one package . the key is talk to an agent who can compare rates with
        many carriers and make sure your home is valued correctly .
      - Car insurance is regulated by each state 's insurance commissioner . Therefore
        each company is going to reflect your driving record and how far you drive
        to work each day and if you use your car in your business and if you have
        a car that qualifies for discounts due to small engine or if you have the
        biggest engine and the loudest mufflers in town . Who provides the cheapest
        car insurance-you do .
      - There are many people who need auto insurance but do not own a car . Many
        people drive a company car most of the time but need to rent a car for a short
        period of time . Others do not live in the USA and need to drive a rental
        car when they return . The first place they can buy insurance is from the
        rental company . They will provide a full range of coverages . As an alternative
        the driver can carry a non-owned auto policy .
      - Boy there are any number of reasons that I can offer to illustrate why our
        car insurance , or any insurance for that matter , may go up , or down for
        that matter . Major factors in pricing usually include one 's age , drivng
        experience , driving history , claims history , etc. . You may pay more for
        car insurance in certain areas of the country than others based upon population
        , company experience within those territories etc. . Naturally another major
        factor is the year , make model and type of car that you drive and insure
        . Finally , over the years , it has become common and accepted to include
        one 's credit history among the many factors that a company uses in order
        to consider and properly price a car insurance policy .
      - Teen drivers are among the most expensive to insure , because they have the
        most tickets and accidents . A 17 year old can reduce her auto insurance by
        1 -RRB- comparing prices , 2 -RRB- buying an older car that does not need
        comprehensive and collision -LRB- full coverage -RRB- , and 3 -RRB- by driving
        fewer miles in a year . Some kinds of cars are more dangerous and therefore
        more expensive to insure , so make sure you check insurance rates before you
        purchase a vehicle . A teen driver may also be excluded from having an insurance
        policy on his own , so it usually makes sense to join a family policy . You
        would also want to take advantage of any multi-car or multi-line discounts
        offered by your insurance company . These would be the same way that any driver
        can reduce her insurance rates , but for the teen driver it is particularly
        important to follow these steps . In addition , a clean driving record is
        paramount . So drive carefully and those rates will go down over time .
      - When you purchase car insurance the insurance agetns require that you declare
        who the primary oerator of each vehicle . This declaration means that if the
        `` driver '' of the car has an accident then the coverage of that vehicle
        with that driver was declared on the application . What happens if you are
        driving a friend 's car with his permission-then you are covered by the permission
        granted to drive the car , assuming you are legally licensed .
      - If you have an insurance policy and sell your car because you purchased a
        new car you can easily change cars on your policy . Simply call your insurance
        agent and notify them of the sale of the old car and purchase on the new car
        and the agent can update your policy . Rates will adjust to take into account
        the car you chose on a pro-rated basis .
      - -- > Normal 0 It is my understanding you will find CDW in many car rental
        agreements and it is an abbreviation for Collision Damage Waiver . When you
        rent a car , you are required to sign a rental agreement . Most renters fail
        to read the agreement but in most cases the agreement states you agree to
        accept full responsibility should the car is damaged in any way , even if
        that damage is not your fault ! For an additional daily charge , often $ 20
        or more , rental companies will not charge you should you return their car
        with damage or report it stolen . Thats a pretty hefty charge for what many
        would consider one day 's comprehensive and collision coverage . Annualized
        that amounts to rental customers paying more than $ 7000 a year just for potential
        damage to the car ! Your own car insurance may extend to cover damage to cars
        you rent but check with your agent or insurer to make sure . Even if your
        insurance coverage extends to cover a rental car you are driving , it may
        not cover all the charges the rental company makes you responsible for . Often
        when signing the rental agreement , you assume responsibility for the loss
        of value to their car if it is damaged , the loss of rental revenue they lose
        while the car is being repaired and even their administrative costs incurred
        as a result of the damage . These costs are usually not covered by most personal
        auto insurance policies . And more than likely , you have given the rental
        company permission to put those charges right on your credit card . Be alert
        !
      labels:
      - Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you
        have proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car . It is never a good
        idea to drive a car without insurance . If you traded a car in , then the
        coverage on the older car may extend to the new car temporarily , but you
        need to call your agent as soon as possible and get it changed . Most dealerships
        have an insurance agent they work with who can get you coverage as well .
      - Generally speaking , probably not . Most States require you to have at least
        a mandatory minimum amount of Liability Insurance in order for a car to be
        registered . Your Car Dealership will need to obtain proof of that coverage
        from your Isurance Professional in order to register the car for you , so
        without such proof , they ca n't really do anything to complete the deal .
        In addition , unless you are paying cash for the car , it will either be financed
        or leased and in both cases , there are requirements to have both Comprehensive
        and Collision coverage on the car and , in the case of a lease , the required
        amount of Liability coverage which is somewhat more than any State 's minimum
        requirement .
      - Probably not . Most states -LRB- including here in CT -RRB- require proof
        of insurance as a condition of registering your car . Dealerships will require
        that your insurance professional send them an Insurance Identification Card
        so that they can process the registration for you . Likewise , if you are
        either leasing or securing a loan to purchase your car , the financial institution
        will also require you to have the proper insurance coverage in place in order
        to finalize the sale .
      - If you have an existing auto insurance policy then you should be able to drive
        the new vehicle of the lot . You want to verify with your insurance provider
        your coverage 's . If you do not have any insurance in place do not drive
        the car anywhere until you have secured an insurance policy . Besides the
        fact you are required to have insurance to operate any motor-vehicle it would
        sure be a bummer to wreck your new car and have no coverage .
      - The answer you are looking for is no . You will not be able to take delivery
        of your newly purchased vehicle without proof of coverage for the vehicle
        . Proof of coverage is just one of the many documents that you will need to
        sign in order to complete the purchase of the vehicle to make it yours . Congratulations
        on your new vehicle !

      - Cash surrender value comes only with Whole Life Insurance , never with Term
        . It is the amount you can terminate your policy and receive . That amount
        includes both what you put in and what profit you made . The profit is taxable
        , just as most profit would be taxable . A far better idea would be NOT to
        surrender your Whole Life Policy , but instead to keep it and borrow against
        it and either then not repay it or choose to repay it as you wish . You continue
        to grow in value , even when the loan is out , and your policy stays in force
        , although the death benefit is reduced by the loan until it is paid back
        . There are numerous option you should discuss with a qualified agent . Gary
        Lane , Registered Representative , New York Life , 949 797 2424 . Call anytime

      - The cash surrender value in life insurance is only taxable on the amount over
        your basis . Let me explain . Basis is considered the premium you paid in
        . For example , lets say over 20 years , you paid $ 1000 per year , totaling
        $ 20k . In this example , the cash value is $ 35k . The taxable amount is
        going to be what you have earned over the $ 20k you put in so $ 15,000 in
        this example is taxable . Consider however not surrendering this policy but
        taking loans out instead . Loans are not taxable , do not have to be paid
        back although I would recommend doing so in many situations , and as long
        as you pay the premiums on the policy to keep it in force , you will have
        no tax concerns . The Key here is NOT to let the policy lapse . Otherwise
        you may have a taxable event if the money you took out as a loan is greater
        that your basis . Contact your agent or reach out to me if you would like
        to learn why I would recommend you pay yourself back on the loan . Good Luck
        .
      - Whether a `` Life Insurance check '' is taxable depends on what kind of life
        insurance check it is . You did n't say if it was the death benefit proceeds
        , or if it was a cash withdrawal from the policy , or if it was a loan against
        the cash value of the policy . The payment of the death benefit to the beneficiary
        is NOT taxable . A check for a LOAN against the cash value is NOT taxable
        . However if you surrender the policy for the cash value or if you do a partial
        surrender for cash , if you receive more money than you have paid in , -LRB-
        cash basis of the policy -RRB- , then the amount in excess of premiums paid
        in WILL be taxable as ordinary income .
      - When you surrender your life insurance policy , your coverage ends and you
        stop paying premiums . The insurance company will pay the cash surrender value
        of the policy which will take a week or two . The cash surrender value is
        less than the total cash value in the early years of a policy due to a surrender
        charge which is usually a charge that decline to zero over a period of 5-20
        years , depending on the policy . Any policy loans outstanding also reduce
        the cash value . If you have any gain in the policy - cash surrender value
        less premiums - then it will be taxable as income .
      - 'When you say NWML , I assume you are referring to Northwestern Mutual Life
        . Since I ''m not a NWML agent , it ''s hard to comment on the specifics of
        the carrier ''s product , but can hopefully provide some general insight for
        this type of program . These types of policies typically feature a combination
        structure of part whole life and part term insurance . Whole life insurance
        can not be converted to an annuity , nor can term life insurance . If the
        policy was surrendered for the cash value of the whole life side of the policy
        -LRB- term life insurance does not build cash value -RRB- , the monies could
        be used towards an annuity . Please note , if there is a loan -LRB- and any
        interest on the loan -RRB- on the policy , any remaining surrender charges
        , the dollar amount you receive can be lower than the policy ''s cash value
        -LRB- think : cash value - loans - interest on loans - surrender charges =
        amount you actually receive -RRB- . Also , you may want to verify whether
        there would be a taxable gain on the policy before surrendering it -LRB- the
        cash value in the policy exceeds the premiums paid into it -RRB- . Also ,
        the only way a whole life insurance policy pays a dividend to the policyowner
        is if the policy is a participating whole life policy -LRB- non-participating
        policies do not offer any dividend structure - only the build-up of cash value
        -RRB- . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me
        for help and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .'
      - For permanent life insurance , the policy owner has the right to borrow from
        the cash value subject to the terms in the contract . So , the owner can borrow
        life insurance cash values , even prior to age 59-1/2 , without a tax penalty
        as it is not a distribution . Loans will reduce the policys death benefit
        and cash value available for use . But use care here since if the policy lapses
        or is surrendered in full while there is an outstanding loan the amount of
        the outstanding loan is taxable to the extent that the policy 's gross cash
        value exceeds the policy owner 's basis -LRB- sum of premiums paid -RRB- in
        the contract . Policies that have a cash surrender value and have been in
        force for awhile have a maximum loanable value of close to the cash surrender
        value . Your annual statement may also have the value for loan purposes .
        Policies vary widely and there are many factors to consider . The best way
        to get a current value is to contact your life insurance professional or the
        insurance company directly .
      - Life Insurance Cash Surrender Value is what will be returned to you if you
        cancel a permanent life insurance policy that has a cash value available .
        This surrender value may be less than the actual cash value as all loans will
        be paid back & surrender fees will be taken . Beware , if the surrender value
        is more than the money or premium you have paid in , there may be a taxable
        event you will have to deal with .
      - When talking about cash value in life insurance policies it is important to
        differentiate between the policy value and the surrender value . For example
        , in a universal life insurance policy the policy value -LRB- or fund value
        -RRB- would be the accumulated cash value which is earning interest . However
        , almost all universal life insurance policies have a decreasing surrender
        charge schedule . This means that if you were to surrender the policy in the
        early years the surrender charge could reduce most -LRB- or all -RRB- of the
        value you receive . The value you would receive is called the net surrender
        value , because it is net of all charges . At some point , say 10 or 20 years
        down the road , the surrender charges will go away and the policy value will
        equal the net surrender value . This is part of the reason why cash value
        life insurance should always be looked at as a long term proposition .
      - Yes . Policy loans are an ownership right . You can borrow life insurance
        cash values , even prior to age 59-1/2 , without a tax penalty as it is not
        a distribution . Loans will reduce the policys death benefit and cash value
        available for use . But use care here since if the policy lapses or is surrendered
        in full while there is an outstanding loan the amount of the outstanding loan
        is taxable to the extent that the policy 's gross cash value exceeds the policy-owner
        's basis -LRB- sum of premiums paid -RRB- in the contract . Policies that
        have a cash surrender value and have been inforce for awhile have a maximum
        loanable value of close to the cash surrender value . Your annual statement
        may also have the value for loan purposes . Policies vary widely and there
        are many factors to consider . The best way to get a current value is to contact
        your life insurance professional or the insurance company directly . The preceding
        is for planning purposes only and is not tax or legal advice . Consult with
        your tax or legal adviser .
      - Generally , none if proper steps are taken . Life insurance death benefit
        proceeds received by a beneficiary are income tax-free in most cases . This
        is a key feature of life insurance . Common exceptions include business-owned
        life insurance issued , or materially modified , after August 17 , 2006 which
        may be taxable unless specific steps are taken during time of application
        and annually thereafter to meet conditions which allow the proceeds to be
        income tax-free . Another exception is a tax trap where life insurance contracts
        with three parties involved may also have unexpected taxable implications
        . Beyond the death benefit tax-free characteristics , the cash values have
        important tax aspects as well . Cash value builds free of tax . If the policy-owner
        accesses cash values via withdrawals of some of the cash value -LRB- after
        policy year 15 -RRB- , the amounts are income tax-free return of basis -LRB-
        premiums paid -RRB- in the contract . After that , the gain would be income
        taxable . Special tax rules exist for distributions in the first 15 policy
        years . If the policy-owner accesses cash values by taking a policy loan ,
        the amounts would be income tax-free . As long as the policy is not lapsed
        prior to the net death benefit being paid , the policy loans are never taxed
        . If there is a large loan and the policy is allowed to lapse , income tax
        would be due that year on all of the gain in the contract . In the event of
        a full surrender of the policy for its cash value , there would be income
        tax to the extent of gain in the contract .
      - No , Term life insurance does not usually have a cash surrender value . Term
        insurance buys pure protection rather than building up a cash value , and
        that is why the costs of Term life insurance is usually lower than policies
        that have cash value . Return of Premium -LRB- ROP -RRB- Term is one type
        of Term that could have a cash surrender value if you kept the policy long
        enough .
      - Cash surrender value life insurance refers to the cash build up in a permanent
        life insurance plan and not available on term policies . Permanent policies
        are known by names of whole life , universal life , indexed universal life
        and variable life . The best way to locate your exact cash value in your policy
        is to find the illustrations page located about 10 to 12 pages in your policy
        . Look at the corresponding policy year you are in and the value is out beside
        . There is no partial value for partial years . Your cash value must be calculated
        by a full policy year . Most cash value plans have no value for the first
        6 or 7 years due to all premiums paying up the death benefit or face amount
        .
      - The cash surrender value is the portion of your insurance that you have built
        up your own money in . Whole-life insurance by design is really like a reducing
        term policy with a cash account that builds guaranteed cash value as you get
        further and further into the policy years . All whole-life policies have a
        maturity date where your cash has built up to the point that you are completely
        self insured and the actual insured portion -LRB- the part the insurance company
        has at risk -RRB- has gone to zero . You can use your cash value while you
        are living through policy loans , cash surrenders , or using it to buy reduced
        paid up insurance .
      - Yes , you can cash out or what your referring to is surrendering the policy
        . Before you do , I would recommend that you consider a couple thoughts .
        First , if you surrender this policy , you will no longer have life insurance
        . Are you planning on replacing this policy ? Consider this carefully . Second
        , depending on how long you have had your policy , you might get some cash
        value paid to you . If there is a lot of growth , you may have to consider
        the tax consequenses as if you get back more than what was paid into the policy
        , the difference will probably create a tax burden . There are options other
        than surrendering a policy if you want the or need the cash value . Consider
        taking a loan or just withdrawing the cash value . In either case , please
        consult with your agent or broker to review all your options and any consequenses
      - The cost index that Peggy refers to above here is the Net Payment cost index
        . There is also a cost index for `` surrender value '' of a policy . The surrender
        value of a policy is based on how much premium has been paid , how much cash
        value has accumulated , and cost of insurance . The surrender value of a policy
        is paid to the policy holder when they terminate and surrender the policy
        .
      - Cash Surrender Value on a Life Insurance Policy will vary from company to
        company . Surrender charges can be punitive in the first 5-7 years of a policy
        and can extend out to 19 years with some companies . The account value less
        the surrender charge debited is the surrender value . Most life insurance
        policies are illiquid in the early years .
      - With Universal Life products , there are taxable events when you take withdrawals
        against the cash value , when your cash value is in excess of your policy
        basis . However , if the policy is owned and for the benefit of a person with
        insurable interest -LRB- business partner , family member or love interest
        -RRB- proceeds paid are NOT taxable . Death benefit is only taxable when it
        is investor owned .
      - What is your life insurance policy worth ? If you have Term life insurance
        , it will only pay out the death benefit if you pass , so it does not have
        a cash value while you are alive . If you own Return of Premium Term life
        insurance , you may be able to get back some of what you paid in , if you
        kept it long enough . If you have Whole Life or Universal Life with a cash
        value , it is worth to you now the amount of the surrender value . If you
        surrendered it , you would get that cash value . You can determine the current
        value by requesting an in force illustration from your agent of the company
        through which the policy was purchased .
      - If you leave the cash value in your policy , it grows tax deferred . If you
        take it out , or it is given to your beneficiary after death , the life insurance
        cash value that is below your policy 's `` basis '' is not considered taxable
        income . Cost basis is the premiums you paid into the policy , minus any dividends
        that may have been already paid to you . If cash value greater than basis
        is paid out , the amount above basis is taxable .
      - Cash surrender value of the policy is the asset value of a life insurance
        contract . As property , life insurance has value and is liquid . If the policy
        owner decides to `` cash in '' the policy , the insurance company will pay
        the cash surrender value to the owner within a week or two .
      labels:
      - Cash surrender value comes only with Whole Life Insurance , never with Term
        . It is the amount you can terminate your policy and receive . That amount
        includes both what you put in and what profit you made . The profit is taxable
        , just as most profit would be taxable . A far better idea would be NOT to
        surrender your Whole Life Policy , but instead to keep it and borrow against
        it and either then not repay it or choose to repay it as you wish . You continue
        to grow in value , even when the loan is out , and your policy stays in force
        , although the death benefit is reduced by the loan until it is paid back
        . There are numerous option you should discuss with a qualified agent . Gary
        Lane , Registered Representative , New York Life , 949 797 2424 . Call anytime
        . Thank you .
      - The cash surrender value in life insurance is only taxable on the amount over
        your basis . Let me explain . Basis is considered the premium you paid in
        . For example , lets say over 20 years , you paid $ 1000 per year , totaling
        $ 20k . In this example , the cash value is $ 35k . The taxable amount is
        going to be what you have earned over the $ 20k you put in so $ 15,000 in
        this example is taxable . Consider however not surrendering this policy but
        taking loans out instead . Loans are not taxable , do not have to be paid
        back although I would recommend doing so in many situations , and as long
        as you pay the premiums on the policy to keep it in force , you will have
        no tax concerns . The Key here is NOT to let the policy lapse . Otherwise
        you may have a taxable event if the money you took out as a loan is greater
        that your basis . Contact your agent or reach out to me if you would like
        to learn why I would recommend you pay yourself back on the loan . Good Luck
        .

      - The good news is that annuity income is usually reported by the insurance
        company issuing the annuity . When they make a disbursement they also issue
        appropriate documentation to assist in filing your taxes . They send identical
        information to the Internal Revenue Service . Generally speaking when money
        is withdrawn from an annuity it is treated as interest and then taxed as ordinary
        income until the interest is exhausted and only the basis -LRB- the sum of
        premiums paid -RRB- remains . That money can be recovered free of income tax
        . If the annuity is annuitized , that is paid out in monthly installments
        either over an extended period of time or the lifetime of the annuitant ,
        then an exclusion factor is determined and applied to each payment . A part
        of each payment will be taxed as ordinary income . The bad news is that these
        principles apply to non-qualified annuities held by individuals and these
        barely touch all the situations that can arise and the taxation of those unique
        situations . While this response is not meant to take the place of legal and
        accounting professional advice it should alert you to some of the complexities
        of taxing annuities . The most obvious situation is when an annuity is held
        as an asset of qualified pension plan . This includes defined benefit plans
        ; defined contribution plans -LRB- 401 -LRB- k -RRB- , IRAs and many others
        . The income taken by these plans is taxed as ordinary income unless it is
        taken prior to age fifty-nine and a half . If taken earlier it could be subject
        to a penalty tax of an additional ten per cent . Where annuities taxation
        becomes complex is when deferred annuities are transferred . That is when
        a person gives another person an annuity on their life , or the life of a
        third party . The basic rule is that the transfer is treated as surrender
        and taxed accordingly . The annuity that is transferred is treated as having
        been fully paid . It then has a basis of the value that was taxed . For estate
        planning reasons the ownership of an annuity is sometimes held by a trust
        and this leads to another set of taxation considerations involving the non-natural
        person rule . Who is going to be taxed is the basic issue and this can be
        quite tangled . Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules . Taxation
        is fairly straightforward if the annuity is annuitized . State laws concerning
        probate can create some unexpected outcomes and taxation . When an individual
        owns an annuity and the annuitant is another person , perhaps a spouse , the
        death of the owner triggers the beneficiary provision and another third person
        could suddenly own the contract upsetting the intentions of the couple , even
        if it is a child . Many of the taxation rules are specific to individual insurance
        companies and it is wise to carefully make sure that the company you select
        from whom to purchase the annuity follows the procedures that will maintain
        your plan and keep taxation as uncomplicated as possible . Absent all other
        plans , the IRS frequently calls for a liquidation of a transferred annuity
        within five years . The key is the desire to get the tax question settled
        .
      - In Canada , immediate and deferred annuities are , with one exception , taxed
        on an accrual basis . The growth or income is taxed as earned , not as received
        . How the income is taxed , depends , if it is interest income or , in the
        case of Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIFs -RRB- , interest , dividends
        or capital gains . Prescribed Annuities enjoy special taxation -LRB- Section
        304 of Income Tax Act -RRB- . They are taxed on a straight line basis rather
        than on an accrual basis . If you qualify for a prescribed annuity then total
        amount of `` expected '' interest is averaged based on the number of payments
        . For example invest in a prescribed life income annuity and your `` life
        expectancy '' is 22 years . The amount of investment DIVIDED BY `` life expectancy
        '' EQUALS return of your principle and it is not taxed . The annuity payment
        SUBTRACT the return of your principle is taxable . The tax savings can be
        substantial , which is why prescribed annuities are often used to increase
        after tax income . Especially for those who prefer guaranteed interest income
        . A life insurance policy can replace the capital for your estate . Depending
        on the the individual circumstances , increases of after tax income can be
        50 % or more . Implementing a strategy involving payout annuities is sometimes
        complicated , it is however , always permanent . Search for Retirement / Financial
        planner in your area . Then look for an experienced life insurance broker
        with a professional designation such as a CLU or CFP . If you have further
        questions , or feel that I could be of assistance please contact me .

      - Many employees have been surprised and concerned to see the value of their
        employer provided health insurance being reported on their W2 's . This is
        a requirement of the Affordable Care Act . Under transitional relief guidelines
        issued , so far only employers who issue 250 or more W2 forms in a calendar
        year are required to report this information . Eventually all employers who
        provide health insurance to their employees will be required to report this
        information on the employee 's W2 . This reporting of the employer paid amount
        for health insurance is for `` informational '' purposes only and is not being
        added to the employee 's gross income for income tax purposes . There are
        some skeptics who see this as a precursor to the eventual tax treatment of
        employer paid health insurance as employee income at some future date but
        at this time there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act or any pending legislation
        that would do this . Where this reporting of employer paid health insurance
        will become a tax issue will be in 2018 when the `` Cadillac Tax '' portion
        of the health care law goes into effect . The Cadillac Tax will be a 40 %
        excise tax imposed on health insurance plans whose annual premium costs exceed
        $ 10,200 for an individual or $ 27,500 for family coverage -LRB- these amounts
        will be indexed for inflation -RRB- . So , an employer in 2018 who finds themselves
        with health plan premium levels exceeding these amounts will be assessed a
        40 % tax penalty . While such annual premium amounts may seem unreachable
        by many persons in 2014 . In some areas of the country , and especially with
        some very rich collectively bargained plans , total costs are already coming
        close to these trigger points . When one observes the increases in group health
        insurance plan costs already triggered by the requirements of the Affordable
        Care Act in 2014 and applies projected inflationary trend increases over the
        next few years it becomes much easier to estimate that a larger portion of
        employer based plans could find themselves subject to this tax penalty . This
        is one of the underlying motivations for more employers to move to high deductible
        health insurance plans in order to reduce their premium costs .
      - When you need to file a Homeowners Insurance Claim , the best and quickest
        way to handle it is to call the CLAIMS Telephone number listed on your Homeowners
        Insurance declarations page . Most carriers have a 24 Hour reporting line
        for claims ; the station is staffed by an individual trained to take an initial
        report and pass it on to the assigned claims adjustor based on the type of
        claim and geographical location of the loss . Once the preliminary report
        is taken , a claims number is assigned , an adjustor is assigned and the preliminary
        record is report to the National Database also known as CLUE ; CLUE is a tool
        used industry wide to review prior claims activity on homes . The CLUE report
        will later be updated eventual showing the Closed Status and total amount
        paid by the insurance carrier to resolve the claim . When making the initial
        claim report , it is beneficial to only offer a simple and general explanation
        of the nature of the loss ; it is always better to give all the details directly
        to the claims adjustor as the initial claims report is usually not taken by
        a person licensed and trained with the capabilities of the insurance adjustor.In
        most cases , the insurance carrier will assign and adjustor who will make
        an initial contact within 1 business day . The adjustor will make an appointment
        to come out and review the damages claimed , a detailed estimate of the required
        repairs will be prepared and the adjustor willinterpret the policy to determine
        if and to what extent coverage applies to the damage incurred ; the final
        process will be a resolution letter mailed to the insured with a full accounting
        of the situation and perhaps an associated check for repairs . In some cases
        , an initial payment may be offered holding back thedepreciated portion of
        the loss until thedamages or items are replaced after which the carrier will
        reimburse the insured for the full replacement cost of the items as long as
        the policy coverseverything on a replacement cost basis . Any specificquestions
        regarding a loss should be directly discussed with the claims adjustorwho
        is licensed and responsible to handle the complete transaction and explain
        the processto the insured . Prior to any claim occurrence , it may alsobe
        a good idea to contact a licensed insurance representative to learn the process
        and best recommended method of handling thesituation should youencounter a
        claim .
      - An inspection report for life insurance is an extensive report that is done
        to verify confidential information about a life insurance applicant . Most
        inspection reports are done only on very large policies , and the majority
        are done by phone . With some multi-million dollar cases a face to face interview
        may be required . If the inspection report is for a business , it will ask
        about the nature of the business , make up of the business , location , where
        they do business , and if any air travel or travel to unsafe countries is
        involved . Personal information will include health problems , dangerous hobbies
        , tobacco use , drug/alcohol use , and anything else that affects life insurance
        risk . They will also ask income and net worth , liabilities , and justification
        for amount and purpose of life insurance . Inspection reports are ordered
        by the life insurance underwriter from private inspection bureaus and are
        kept confidential from everyone except the life insurance company that made
        the request .
      - The biggest mistake self employed people is in reporting annual income . Interestingly
        , men tend to understate and women tend to overstate ! For purposes of Obamacare
        subsidy , the premium you pay and the policy coverage is driven by age , household
        size , location and income . The government is paying part of your premium
        and if they give you too much subsidy , at tax time they take it back on your
        tax return . This could leave you owing a lot of money . It is vital to report
        accurately and to report income changes in timely way . For the best results
        , connect with an agent in your local area . This person will review your
        subsidy with you annually and can assist you during the year .
      - Generally , unless a Police Report is filed no points will appear on your
        driving record . If however your insurance company pays a claim it will show
        up on a CLUE report as a claim . Since you have reported it to your insurance
        company , it will be in their records on the CLUE report anyway . If you just
        called and asked your agent what to do , he probably would not have reported
        the incident to the company . If this is the case , pay the $ 200 out of your
        pocket , get a release signed for documentation .
      - Yes but it tends to have fewer rules and compliance issues to follow than
        say a 401k for those who can adopt this plan . It is an older plan design
        established for the self employed & small businesses . Like a Traditional
        IRA contributions are pre-tax as they can reduce the adjusted gross income
        reportable on your income tax return . As such distributions are taxable as
        ordinary income but not subject to payroll tax as these were paid in the reportable
        year the income was earned .
      - Most life insurance proceeds do not have to be reported at all . If you are
        taking payments on a monthly or annual basis , you need to report the interest
        that the insurance company is paying you for retaining your money . You report
        this in the same spot where you report other earned interest .
      - It can , yes . Naturally talk to your Insurance Professional about the specific
        terms and conditions of your policy , but in most cases , you will find that
        there is coverage , subject to your policy deductible . In order to open a
        theft claim , in most cases , you will need to file a loss report with your
        local police and obtain a copy of that report for the claims professional
        . The claims person will also need to have a very good description of the
        bike , including color and serial number if you have it . Photos are a very
        good thing to have as well .
      - Talk to your Insurance Professional about the terms and conditions of your
        particular policy , but yes , under most circumstances , there would be coverage
        for this type of loss . It is more than likely that you would have to file
        a stolen property report with the local Police and obtain a copy of that report
        to submit to your insurance company . Understand that your policy may have
        specific `` inside limits '' for computers which might cap the settlement
        amount . Also keep in mind that any such loss settlement would be subject
        to your policy 's property deductible .
      - In Georgia , you can file under your uninsured motorist coverage if an accident
        is caused by someone else even if you are unsure who they are . If there is
        an impact with you then a police report usually suffices . Without an impact
        with you such as the person that cut you off then a non related unbiased witness
        along with the police report usually works . Of course this does n't apply
        if you do n't carry uninsured motorist coverage . Being able to file it this
        way rather than your collision coverage should help your rates by not having
        an at fault accident on your record .
      - Last November , my wife faced the same situation . Her car was struck by another
        car . The other driver was 100 % at fault . The driver of the other car was
        not the owner of the car . The other insurance company paid 100 % of the damages
        . We got paid because we got a police report that identified the other car
        , the other driver , their responsibility AND THE OTHER INSURANCE COMPANY
        . Because we new who the other company was , we went directly to them and
        presented the claim . If you have an accident and it 's not your fault , get
        a police report and collect directly .
      - Each state has it 's statue of limitation on Workers Comp . claim . It 's
        highly advisable to report your injury as soon as possible . After 30-45 days
        you may loose your right for a workers comp . claim . It is also known , that
        an injury may show up after a prolong time , like limited poisoning received
        during an employee visit of warehouse , where mercury was spilled . In that
        case , you are better to get a check up and report any injury as soon as the
        accident was discovered .
      - 'An important thing to know is what they do n''t ask you but do check . For
        instance , insurance companies will check : Your MIB -LRB- medical insurance
        bureau -RRB- to see if you have applied with other companies and if you have
        been declined . You MVD report -LRB- Motor Vehicle Department -RRB- to see
        if you have any outstanding tickets , felonies , or dui ''s . Your Pharmacy
        Report to see what medications you have been prescribed by Doctors . Make
        sure you answer the above questions honestly on the applications as the underwriters
        will be checking this information .'
      - There are two ways to measure whether an auto insurance policy is cheap .
        From the television advertisements you could think that the premium is the
        way to determine who has the cheapest insurance . Your state insurance commissioner
        is charged to make sure that insurance companies keep their promises . He
        does this by making sure that the premiums being charged are adequate . Since
        all insurance companies doing business in your state are offering their policies
        to the same group of people , it would seem that ultimately they would have
        pretty similar experience and would charge fairly similar rates . When you
        hear an advertisement telling you that customers saved on average 25 % by
        switching to company A , you need to understand that information like that
        is the result of after sales surveys . This is what people report . That is
        why almost every insurance company has similar advertisements . If everyone
        is saving money over everyone else , something isnt quite right . The other
        way to determine cheap insurance is to determine by value . You buy automobile
        insurance to pay claims when you have an accident or your car is damaged .
        When this occurs how much you paid in premium may be insignificant if the
        policy you hold on your automobile is inadequate to handle the law suits coming
        your way not to mention the repair of your vehicle . A few days ago a client
        was struck a glancing blow on the right rear of his car while stopped at a
        signal light . The car then proceeded to hit the expensive car stopped alongside
        my clients , pushing that car into a small car with two children on board
        which then rolled forward and knocked over and ran over a motorcycle operator
        . The driver who started this mayhem is not thinking about how much he paid
        in premiums , he is thinking about how much the company is going to pay in
        the costs that will come next . Incidentally , two people left the scene in
        ambulances and others were undoubtable injured . The way to have the cheapest
        automobile insurance is to secure the services of a competent insurance agent
        . The agent will listen to you , provide sound financial advice and communicate
        clearly with you and with the insurance company . In the end the agent will
        guide you to appropriate limits . These limits will determine how well the
        insurance company performs when you have an accident . Regardless of which
        company the agent and you agree upon , the real test is going to be how well
        the company performs when you have an accident . There are two other fallacies
        that affect an automobile insurance purchase . The first is the idea of legal
        limits . If you purchase automobile on the basis of the limits required by
        law you may well bankrupt yourself when you have an accident . Those limits
        can handle some accidents but certainly will stop paying long before the bills
        stopping coming if the accident involves much personal injury or the car struck
        is expensive . The other fallacy is full coverage . Most consider full coverage
        to be enough to satisfy the state requirement and enough to satisfy the lender
        . While keeping those entities satisfied you are still assuming too much exposure
        personally . Your company could run out of money before everyone is satisfied
        . Then they will sue you directly .
      - An annuity is a systematic method of accumulation and liquidation of money
        that you desire to set aside for a later retirement . In the accumulation
        phase you mostly make deposits into your account . In the liquidation phase
        , you can take money from the account to provide a steady monthly income for
        a period of years , and even for the balance of your life . Annuities pay
        interest like a savings account . Unlike a bank savings account , you do n't
        pay income tax on the interest gained until you begin liquidating your account
        with either a stream of payments of lump withdrawals . When interest you earn
        is not taxed today , it has a chance to compound and grow faster . The government
        will get to tax your gain at a later time , when you start taking out the
        money . Some annuities can be deducted from income on your 1040 tax statement
        and this also helps your retirement funds grow faster . These types of annuities
        are referred to as `` qualified annuities '' because the annuity meets the
        tax law qualifications that permit taking a reduction of income for the annuity
        deposit . While there are lots of rules , if you go back to the start and
        realize that an annuity is nothing more than a method of accumulating money
        for retirement , and also a method of distributing money from the account
        in retirement , you get most of what an annuity really is . Good luck .
      - The wording suggests the question concerns income tax reporting . Life insurance
        death benefit proceeds are usually exempt from income tax . There are exceptions
        . In some cases where a policy is owned by the insured 's employer , the proceeds
        may be taxable income . The proceeds may also be taxable if the policy -LRB-
        ordeath benefit -RRB- was sold or otherwise transferred in exchange for valuable
        consideration . If a policy is owned by a qualified plan , the death benefit
        will not be taxable when paid to the plan but would be taxable to the plan
        beneficiary when withdrawn .
      - Long-term care premiums may be deductible on both the state and federal level
        as allowed in the IRS 1040 tax return and the state income tax return . There
        is a formula that changes annually that reflects the amount of premium that
        can be counted as deductible . However , there have been changes to the amount
        of allowable medical expenses that can be deducted since the inception of
        the PPACA . Long-term care benefits are not taxable as regular income as long
        as the policy is clearly indicated `` tax-qualified '' . Most policies sold
        today are tax-qualified and benefits paid from them do not need to be reported
        as income on tax returns .
      labels:
      - The good news is that annuity income is usually reported by the insurance
        company issuing the annuity . When they make a disbursement they also issue
        appropriate documentation to assist in filing your taxes . They send identical
        information to the Internal Revenue Service . Generally speaking when money
        is withdrawn from an annuity it is treated as interest and then taxed as ordinary
        income until the interest is exhausted and only the basis -LRB- the sum of
        premiums paid -RRB- remains . That money can be recovered free of income tax
        . If the annuity is annuitized , that is paid out in monthly installments
        either over an extended period of time or the lifetime of the annuitant ,
        then an exclusion factor is determined and applied to each payment . A part
        of each payment will be taxed as ordinary income . The bad news is that these
        principles apply to non-qualified annuities held by individuals and these
        barely touch all the situations that can arise and the taxation of those unique
        situations . While this response is not meant to take the place of legal and
        accounting professional advice it should alert you to some of the complexities
        of taxing annuities . The most obvious situation is when an annuity is held
        as an asset of qualified pension plan . This includes defined benefit plans
        ; defined contribution plans -LRB- 401 -LRB- k -RRB- , IRAs and many others
        . The income taken by these plans is taxed as ordinary income unless it is
        taken prior to age fifty-nine and a half . If taken earlier it could be subject
        to a penalty tax of an additional ten per cent . Where annuities taxation
        becomes complex is when deferred annuities are transferred . That is when
        a person gives another person an annuity on their life , or the life of a
        third party . The basic rule is that the transfer is treated as surrender
        and taxed accordingly . The annuity that is transferred is treated as having
        been fully paid . It then has a basis of the value that was taxed . For estate
        planning reasons the ownership of an annuity is sometimes held by a trust
        and this leads to another set of taxation considerations involving the non-natural
        person rule . Who is going to be taxed is the basic issue and this can be
        quite tangled . Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules . Taxation
        is fairly straightforward if the annuity is annuitized . State laws concerning
        probate can create some unexpected outcomes and taxation . When an individual
        owns an annuity and the annuitant is another person , perhaps a spouse , the
        death of the owner triggers the beneficiary provision and another third person
        could suddenly own the contract upsetting the intentions of the couple , even
        if it is a child . Many of the taxation rules are specific to individual insurance
        companies and it is wise to carefully make sure that the company you select
        from whom to purchase the annuity follows the procedures that will maintain
        your plan and keep taxation as uncomplicated as possible . Absent all other
        plans , the IRS frequently calls for a liquidation of a transferred annuity
        within five years . The key is the desire to get the tax question settled
        .
      - In Canada , immediate and deferred annuities are , with one exception , taxed
        on an accrual basis . The growth or income is taxed as earned , not as received
        . How the income is taxed , depends , if it is interest income or , in the
        case of Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIFs -RRB- , interest , dividends
        or capital gains . Prescribed Annuities enjoy special taxation -LRB- Section
        304 of Income Tax Act -RRB- . They are taxed on a straight line basis rather
        than on an accrual basis . If you qualify for a prescribed annuity then total
        amount of `` expected '' interest is averaged based on the number of payments
        . For example invest in a prescribed life income annuity and your `` life
        expectancy '' is 22 years . The amount of investment DIVIDED BY `` life expectancy
        '' EQUALS return of your principle and it is not taxed . The annuity payment
        SUBTRACT the return of your principle is taxable . The tax savings can be
        substantial , which is why prescribed annuities are often used to increase
        after tax income . Especially for those who prefer guaranteed interest income
        . A life insurance policy can replace the capital for your estate . Depending
        on the the individual circumstances , increases of after tax income can be
        50 % or more . Implementing a strategy involving payout annuities is sometimes
        complicated , it is however , always permanent . Search for Retirement / Financial
        planner in your area . Then look for an experienced life insurance broker
        with a professional designation such as a CLU or CFP . If you have further

      - You can get renter 's insurance through the AAA insurance agency , but your
        AAA membership does not automatically include renter 's insurance . You can
        contact AAA or another independent insurance agent and they can compare quotes
        among several different carriers . It is often cheaper to purchase both renters
        and auto insurance through the same company as they will provide discounts
        for multiple policies .
      - AAA Term life insurance has the same guarantees of most Term life insurance
        . As of June , 2012 , their company 's AM Best rating is A - . To compare
        rates with AAA Term life insurance , go to a website offering instant life
        insurance quotes . Also , be sure to review the health requirements needed
        for AAA life insurance before applying . If you apply and are declined , it
        will go on your MIB and could make it more difficult to purchase some other
        life insurance policies .
      - Every rating agency has their own ratings . With AM Best , A + + is their
        best rating . With Fitch , their highest rating is AAA . Moody 's highest
        rating is Aaa . S&P 's best life insurance company rating is AAA . Weiss 's
        highest rating is A + . The companies with the best ratings will have high
        ratings from all these agencies .
      - There is no one top rated life insurance company , but every life insurance
        company has the chance to earn the top ratings from several different rating
        companies . That being said , only a small % of companies get the top rating
        . To find a company 's rating , you can go to their website and hit the ``
        About Us '' tab . The main rating companies are AM Best -LRB- for which A
        + + is their top rating -RRB- , S&P -LRB- for which AAA is highest -RRB- ,
        Fitch -LRB- also uses AAA for best rating -RRB- and Moody 's -LRB- Aaa is
        their top rating -RRB- .
      - As of June , 2012 , the AM Best rating for AAA life insurance was A - . It
        's Term insurance is competitive and has the same guarantees as most life
        insurance companies . It does require fairly good health to get the Term insurance
        , although they offer Whole Life that covers more health conditions . Rather
        than rely on the quotes of one carrier , you might find a better price shopping
        multiple carriers , as you can get via one agency or online website . That
        way , you will have someone that can guide you to another product if you do
        not qualify or do n't care for AAA has to offer .
      - Yes , AAA -LRB- American Automobile Association -RRB- does offer life insurance
        . In order to compare AAA 's life insurance prices to the quotes from other
        companies , visit a website that offers instant life insurance quotes . Be
        sure to compare `` apples to apples '' , such as guarantees and prices at
        the actual health rating that you will be rated with each company .
      - Yes , AAA does offer term life insurance directly to consumers . They have
        a rating of A - from A.M.Best , the life insurance rating company . However
        , unlike homeowners or auto coverage , no carrier can offer a discount for
        life insurance . You will find many carriers less expensive and with higher
        financial ratings than AAA . Find a good independent life insurance agent
        that can help with your coverage .
      - AAA while being best known for its ' auto towing services and for those of
        us old enough to remember , their tripticket map service , does indeed sell
        term insurance . However their are many carriers with higher financial ratings
        that charge less . In fact , I once had a client who worked for AAA but decided
        on a less expensive policy with better ratings and a lower cost .
      - 'There are many factors that affect the rates for homeowners insurance : Homeowner
        -LRB- insured -RRB- - The insured ''s age , credit rating , loss experience
        , prior coveragewill affect the premium charged for a homeowners policy .
        Home location - Location is a very big deal . For example , a home located
        on the coast will be subject to a much higher premium compared to the same
        home located far inland due to the increased possibility of loss from wind
        or storm damage . Likewise , a home located in an area that has excellent
        fire protection -LRB- very close proximity to a fire station -RRB- will have
        a lower premium than the same home located in a secluded location very far
        away from fire protection . Home Construction - A stick-built wood frame home
        is more expensive to insure than the same valued home constructed of fire-resistive
        materials due to the increased potential for catastrophic fire loss with the
        former . Coverage Limits - Obviously a $ 500,000 home will cost more to insure
        than a similarly located/constructed $ 200,000 home .'
      - Home insurance is written for homes . Homes are never typical . It is the
        uniqueness that makes home ownership attractive . A homeowners policy is based
        upon the value of the home , the location of the home , the fire protection
        available , the age of the home and the condition of the home . In addition
        there are other items of interest that will guide an underwriter to evaluate
        the risk of your home
      - Does Long Term Care cover a nursing home ? In most cases the answer is yes
        . However coverage will be created by what you choose for your plan design
        . In most all cases nursing home coverage is a base aspect of any plan , but
        you can choose in many plans to include assisted living or home care along
        with nursing homes .
      - Yes , but most people and a lot of agents do n't realize home insurance does
        n't cover rentals . A homeowner 's policy is meant for the insured that actually
        lives in the home . All policies differ from company to company , but there
        is usually a 30 day period that the home is covered until it becomes a rental
        , vacant , etc and even though you may be paying premiums for a homeowner
        's policy you wo n't be covered because it is no longer a main residence .
        At that point and hopefully you agent advised you of this , that you need
        to get a dwelling policy specifically for covering the building and not the
        contents which is often called a `` landlord '' policy . The morale of the
        story is to be sure what the policy states and if there is a vacant clause
        which there normally is .
      - 'What ''s the importance of Renters Insurance ? If you ''re renting a house
        , condo , or an apartment , the last thing you ''re thinking about is renters
        insurance . Since you do n''t own the building , the landlord is covered ,

        n''t live in your rental unit . LIABILITY INSURANCE . Renters insurance can
        cover injury to another person on your property . It can also include medical

      - No , Medicare is very limited on home health care services . Medicare does
        not cover custodial care either at home or in a facility . Medicare will cover
        some rehab services at home performed by approved skilled therapists or nurses
        . the will not pay for home health aids . You would either have to private
        pay or qualify for Medicaid to receive this type of assistance .
      - Your home should be covered by a Homeowners Insurance Policy with the Dwelling
        Coverage equal or greater to the cost of complete reconstruction of the home
        . In the event of a covered total loss , you will expect your insurance company
        to pay for the rebuilding of your home . In addition to the home itself ,
        you will need to make sure that your Other Structures -LRB- Detached Structures
        -RRB- , Personal Property -LRB- Contents -RRB- and Personal Liability Limits
        are sufficient to cover your interest in the event of a covered risk . It
        is always best to speak to a licensed professional who will ask the appropriate
        questions to assess your risk and therefore suggest the best options to your
        specific case . Once you have assessed sufficient coverage for your home ,
        you may adjust the premium by selecting either a higher or lower deductible
        . A higher deductible would generate a lower premium and a lower deductible
        would generate a higher premium . There is a link providing an online format

      - Medicare Part A is , in short , your hospital insurance . It covers inpatient
        hospital care , skilled nursing facility care , nursing home care , hopsice
        care , and home health services . Please note , there are limitations to what
        Medicare pays and for how long it will pay for given services . If you want
        to have adequate coverage for long-term care types of services -LRB- e.g.
        nursing home care , hospice care , and home services -RRB- , you will want
        to supplement your Medicare coverage with a separate long-term care policy
        . Medicare Part B is , in short , your physician insurance . This part of
        Medicare covers things like doctor visits , lab tests , surgeries , ambulance
        services , durable medical equipment -LRB- DMEs -RRB- , and other outpatient
        services . Medicare Part A & Part B are commonly referred to as Original Medicare
        and only covers about 80 % of your healthcare expenses . A Medigap plan can
        cover all or a portion of the other 20 % of expenses . While 20 % does n't
        seem like it 's going to have a high dollar figure , the bill can add up quite
        fast . The idea of a Medigap plan is to create a predictable expense structure
        . If you do n't have a Medigap plan and visited the hospital/had a surgery/etc
        . , you 'll end up with a massive medical bill real quick . I hope the input
        is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other
        questions . Thanks very much .

      - what is a SIMPLE retirement plan ? A Simple is an inexpensive opportunity
        for a small business to have a retirement plan that does n't break the bank
        in advisor fees . A Simple plan is an IRS approved plan with only a few steps
        to follow so expensive testing and record keeping are n't necessary . For
        any small business who are considering a retirement plan to offer , this should
        be right on top as it does provide a great platform for a business who would
        rather use it 's money to put towards employees retirements rather than third
        party administers plans .
      - Simple IRA is actually an acronym for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees
        Individual Retirement Account . It is an employer sponsored plan similar to
        401ks , 403b , etc. , but with much lower admin costs . It can be funded with
        pretax dollars , but is still subject to FICA , FUTA , SUTA . The contribution
        limits for 2013 are $ 12,000 for those age 50 and younger and $ 14,500 for
        those older than age 50 .
      - 'The most common retirement accounts for the self-employed are SEP IRAs ,
        Simple IRAs and individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s . These plans have two factors
        in common : up-front tax breaks and tax-deferred saving , meaning you do n''t
        pay taxes until you withdraw the money in retirement . The Roth version of
        the individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- is slightly different : you do n''t get an
        up-front tax break , but your money not only grows tax free , withdrawals
        in retirement are also tax-free . The Simplified Employee Pension -LRB- SEP
        -RRB- IRA is probably your best bet.You can open one at virtually any bank
        , mutual fund sponsor or brokerage firm . Annual account fees are low - or
        non-existent . Your contribution limit is based on a simple formula : You
        can put away as much as 25 % of your net income , up to a cap that increases
        periodically to keep pace with inflation - $ 49,000 in 2010 . Money stays
        sheltered from taxes during your savings years , and what ''s additionally
        appealing is a SEP ''s funding flexibility . You can wait to fund the plan
        until you file your taxes . So if your income turns out to be higher than
        expected , you can make a large contribution and cut your tax bill . If you
        have a tough year , you can scale your contribution back . If you work alone
        now , but aspire to bigger things . Then a Savings Incentive Match Plan for
        Employees -LRB- SIMPLE -RRB- IRA may be better for you . With a SIMPLE IRA
        , you can keep investing in the same plan after you hire someone . Though
        do n''t forget what the plan name stands for : you have to match your employees
        '' contributions , up to 3 % of pay . The main problem with a SIMPLE IRA is
        that you can stash away no more than $ 11,500 a year -LRB- $ 14,000 if you
        ''re 50 or over -RRB- , which may not be enough to meet your retirement goals
        . Also , if you need to make a withdrawal from a SIMPLE IRA plan within two
        years of its inception , the 25 % penalty is significantly higher than the
        10 % fee you ''d be charged for early withdrawal from a SEP IRA . Both the
        SEP IRA and individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- make it tough on sole proprietors
        who try to hire even one full-time employee . SEP rules can lock you into
        expensive contributions . With an individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- , unless that
        employee is married to you , you ''ll have to stop funding your plan or convert
        it to the more complex and cumbersome employer version . For that , you ''ll
        surely need professional help , and you may even have to hire a third-party
        plan administrator . That does n''t come cheap . The Individual 401 -LRB-
        k -RRB- is an especially good choice if you are scrambling to build up your
        retirement savings and can afford to sock away a considerable portion of your
        earnings . The generous contribution formula lets you put aside more money
        at a lower income level than you can with a SEP IRA . As an employee , you
        can stash away as much as $ 16,500 . As the boss , you can contribute an additional
        25 % of compensation , up to a maximum of $ 49,000 , including your employee
        contribution . These contributions are discretionary , so you can save the
        maximum in flush years and nothing in tougher times . If you and your spouse
        are both in the plan and enjoy a banner year , you could save a total of $
        98,000 . And if you are both 50 or older and eligible for catch-up contributions
        of $ 5,500 each , the total climbs to $ 109,000 . It ''s also possible to
        take out a loan against an individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- . That can be useful
        if you need funds during a business crunch . You can borrow half the account
        ''s balance , up to $ 50,000 , and typically take up to five years to pay
        it back -LRB- provider rules vary -RRB- . That said , borrowing from a retirement
        plan should be a last resort , since it could seriously undermine your long-term
        goals . Individual 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s come with a bit of bureaucratic hassle
        . Once your balance exceeds a certain level - $ 250,000 in 2010 - you have
        to fill out an IRS form -LRB- form 5500 -RRB- every year , which adds a bit
        to your accountant ''s bill . Before a tax law change in 2001 , Keogh plans
        were a popular choice for high-income self-employed people . These days ,
        they ''ve been largely replaced by SEP IRAs , which have the same contribution
        limits but much less paperwork . Keogh plans come in two varieties : Defined-contribution
        . These plans have two variations : profit-sharing and money-purchase . The
        profit-sharing version of the Keogh is most like the SEP ; there ''s a ceiling
        on contributions - 25 % of compensation , up to a maximum contribution of
        $ 49,000 in 2010 - and below that limit you can put in whatever you can spare
        . You also can change your contribution each year . With the money-purchase
        plan , you pick a percentage of income you ''ll contribute every year , and
        stick with it . If you do n''t , you ''ll owe the IRS a penalty . Defined-benefit
        . This type of Keogh acts as a traditional pension plan , but for one key
        fact : you fund it yourself . You pick the annual pension you want , then
        contribute -LRB- and deduct from your taxes -RRB- whatever amount is needed
        to reach that goal . If you ''re self employed and have a high income - say
        you ''re a doctor or lawyer - this type of plan may allow you to save more
        for retirement than many other plans . Keoghs can be complicated to set up
        , and the paperwork required if you own one is considerable . If you ''re
        interested in establishing a Keogh , consult a financial adviser .'
      - what does Simple retirement plan mean ? It means that someone is using a boilerplate
        retirement plan created by the IRS to provide a retirement program for a small
        business . I love Simples as their name says it all . A Simple is a straight
        forward plan design with only a few requirements to comply with to have the
        plan . The best part for a small business owner is it costs next to nothing
        to provide . There is no testing of the plan which costs money . Just a nominal
        per head fee of active participants . The employer does n't pay fees for testing
        employees and accounting for employees who are n't in the plan . For a small
        business a Simple is a great choice for putting a retirement plan together
        for employees .

        rather use it 's money to put towards employees retirements rather than third
        party administers plans .
      - Which retirement plan is best for small business ? Personally , I like the
        SIMPLE retirement plan for use with small business . Why ? because it 's SIMPLE
        ! This IRS created plan is one of the most inexpensive plans out there for
        a small business . For the business owner the rules are simple and clear .
        NO testing , no ERISA planmath nonsense , no per head fees for all employees
        -LRB- including those that do n't participate -RRB- , in other words if you
        follow the IRS guidelines you save about $ 3k to $ 5k a year in administration
        fees . A simple involves matching -LRB- 3 % a minimum of 3 out of every 5
        years or 1 % for those two years -RRB- employees who participate in the plan
        . While this may seem like a lot of moneyfor amatch . Think of it this way
        . You are rewarding your employees who stay with you , rather than a bunch
        of guys downtown who administer plans . Look closer into these retirement
        plans . They are easy to establish , easy to administer and extremely inexpensive
        to run .
      - If the question is referring to some simple retirement plan , it could mean
        anything . But if youre referring to a SIMPLE IRA , thats another matter .
        Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees Individual Retirement Account a

        portfolio should look like , depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon

        . What you do with one often affects the other . The first step in planning
        for a Good Retirement is to start saving regularly as early as you can . The
        challenge often is that retirement seems so far away that it is easy to put
        off . Now that you have started saving , what are you saving for ? Deciding

        do you want to do for the rest of your life ? A lifestyle planner can help

      - 'In Canada , how you get money from a retirement plan depends on what type
        of plan . If it is a Registered Retirement Plan -LRB- RRSP -RRB- then getting
        money out is as simple as deregistering and surrendering the plan . You will
        have to pay tax as the amount will be added to your income . There will be
        a withholding tax , currently 10 % for up to $ 5,000 , 20 % for $ 5,001 to
        $ 15,000 and 30 % for over $ 15,000 . If it is a pension plan you can not
        get money from the plan other than as an income while you are with the company
        . Depending on circumstances , money from a pension plan is either transferred
        into a `` regular RRSP '''' and can be withdrawn or a `` locked in RRSP ''''
        and usually can not other than as an income . Check with your advisor before
        you do anything to make sure you are making an informed decision . If you

      - Your comment made me laugh ! And yes , I can answer your great question like
        a five year old , I 'm a master of simple ! An annuity is a way of putting
        money aside now to spend later . You get them through insurance companies
        . Once you put the money in it , you should n't touch it . It sits for many
        years growing and waiting for you . Once you get old and need it , you tell
        it you are ready to get paid . It will then start paying you every month until
        you a. -RRB- use it up b. -RRB- pass away or c. -RRB- your surviving spouse
        passes away -LRB- you pick one when you get it -RRB- . They are a way of making
        sure you have money during your retirement . They are not a good idea for
        everybody - -LRB- like riding a bike without training wheels for the first
        ever bike ride -RRB- some people have trouble with their bills , and setting
        aside lots of bill money could be a bad thing , so they have to do what is
        called a ` suitability study ' first . It will help figure out if it is a
        good thing . If the person you talk to does n't do one , they are bad - run
        away ! And some of them are filled with hiding fees and costs , that eat away
        like bad bugs at your money while it is away , so you have to be careful and
        ask ` pacifically what the costs are in total for the annuity . If it does
        n't cost too much , it is a good thing . There are lots of types , so ask
        about all of them and take notes before you even think of giving them your
        money , k ? I hope that helps , please realize that is greatly simplified
        . But the bottom line is that the right annuity can be a great part of your
        retirement plan . Please feel free to contact me for more details , or to
        answer any lingering questions , okay ? Thank you for the ` funnest ' question
        I have ever gotten to answer here !
      - 'Where the best place to save for your retirement depends on your situation
        . As a general rule though a plan that has tax deferral is best . That will
        allow you to receive the full effect of compound interest or growth . In Canada
        plans like Registered Retirement Savings Plans -LRB- RRSP -RRB- are tax deductible
        and provide tax deferred growth , they are designed specifically for retirement
        savings . The income is taxable when it is withdrawn . If you have a plan
        where your employer will contribute and perhaps match your contributions .
        It might a Registered Pension Plan or towards your RRSP , regardless that
        is hard to beat . Other option is a Tax Free Savings Account -LRB- TFSA -RRB-
        where the contributions are not deductible , but have Tax Free growth and
        the money is not taxed on withdrawal . There is no cookie cutter plan or product
        that is best . I really depends on your individual objectives . If you have
        further questions , or feel that I could be of assistance , please do not
        hesitate to contact me . If you would like to work with a local Retirement
        Planner , you could start with a Google search . For example , if you search

      - Being covered by a `` retirement plan '' means that perhaps your employer
        had a 401k plan and you contribute to the retirment plan and the employer
        can `` match '' a percentage = like 3 % . There used to be alot of companies
        that had a `` defined benefit plan '' . Your benefit under a `` defined benefit
        plan '' was caluculated each year by the actuarial firm administering the
        plan . This type of retirement plan is rare . If you contribute to an IRA
        each year when you file your tax returns the tax preparer calculates how much
        of your contribution is allowed to deducted on your tax returns based on current
        tax law . Being covered by a Retirement Plan means that within the definition
        of the tax code you have contributed to a plan that is recognized by the IRS
        as a `` retirement plan .
      - Asking this question tells me that you need the help of a health insurance
        broker familiar with your marketplace . Do a Google search , call the Better
        Business Bureau , look in the Yellow Pages -LRB- if any one does that anymore
        -RRB- , ask a friend , but get somebody to do the leg work for you . Or ,
        of course , you can go to HealthCare.Gov and look up coverage there . When
        using HealthCare.Gov the consumer should understand that not all health insurance
        carriers are available through the government marketplaces and that provider
        networks and approved prescription lists may be different with the same carrier
        depending upon whether you are dealing with their products outside or inside
        of the government marketplaces . One good thing about ObamaCare is that the
        simple answer to your question is just `` apply with an insurance carrier
        . '' The bad news about ObamaCare is that they now give you a specific time
        of year -LRB- the open enrollment -RRB- for you to enroll in coverage and
        after that time only persons experiencing certain change of life status events
        can enroll for individual coverage outside the open enrollment period each
        year . You are asking this question nearly 2 months after the close of the
        first open enrollment period on March 31st , 2014 . If you could have enrolled
        during that open enrollment period but for some reason did n't and have n't
        experienced a change of life status event -LRB- e.g. - marriage , divorce
        , having a baby , losing employer based coverage -RRB- recently then you technically
        ca n't enroll in major medical insurance again until January 1 , 2015 . Being
        uninsured will also technically make you subject to the individual mandate
        tax penalty when you do your individual income taxes next year . Do n't feel
        all alone , millions of people went through the first ObamaCare enrollment
        and still managed to stay uninsured . Some by intention other by inattention
        . If you can pass a few simple medical questions and coverage for pre-existing
        conditions is n't a must then I would suggest you look into getting a Short
        Term Medical policy to tide you over for the rest of the year . Be advised
        that Short Term Medical insurance is not viewedas meeting the requirements
        under ObamaCare for avoiding the individual mandate penalty . But , many people
        are finding that the cost of short term medical insurance is low enough against
        the prices of the new ObamaCare compliant plans that even taking the tax penalty
        into account they are dollars ahead with the short term policy . For advise
        please feel free to contact me .
      - In simple terms adverse selection means that a health insurance company enrolls
        a population mix where the claims being incurred by some enrollees exceed
        the total premiums being paid in by all enrollees . If Insurance Company X
        finds itself paying out $ 1 billion a year in claims while receiving only
        $ 800 million in premium it is experiencing adverse selection and losing $
        200 million that year . Adverse selection can occur in a variety of ways but
        it all comes down to the simple math I described above . Preliminary enrollment
        results from the recently concluded open enrollment period point towards a
        rather broad based adverse selection in the enrollment across the nation .
        The enrollment mix , while trending somewhat better towards the end , still
        indicates that enrollees tended to be more females than males -LRB- women
        consume more health care than men over the course of their lives -RRB- , older
        than the general population -LRB- older persons consume more health care than
        younger people -RRB- , and have more chronic health problems than the general
        population -LRB- for example , the number of enrollees requiring expensive
        HIV medications was substantially above the level of the general population
        -RRB- . We appear to have reached approximately 25 % enrollment in the ``
        young & healthy '' demographic when the initial actuarial projections were
        that the program enrollment mix needed to be around 40 % for things to work
        out . While it is too early to project what this will mean for rates in 2015
        , and the impact will vary from state to state , I am already seeing industry
        reports that are projects substantial double digit rate increases in most
        states and possible triple digit increases in some states . States such as
        New York which had already largely decimated their individual insurance markets
        and had some of the highest insurance rates in the nation to begin with will
        probably be impacted less because of the high starting point they were already
        at . Many states in the south , mid-west and western U.S. which generally
        had much lower health insurance rates prior to ObamaCare implementation will
        likely be the areas who will experience the largest increases . Here in Tennessee
        I am already beginning to see increases for small group plans in the 20 %
        to 60 % range as ObamaCare compliant plan designs are being phased in .
      - What to look for in Disability Insurance ? While there are many options to
        consider with disability insurance , a `` good '' disability policy comes
        down to one defining sentence . The most important thing is `` the definition
        of what disability IS . '' You see payment from a disability plan all comes
        down to what qualifies as a disability based on the definition of disability
        in the contract -LRB- policy -RRB- . If it is not simple and straight forward
        in this definition , you might want to look elsewhere . Pretty much beyond
        the first couple sentences about the definition of disability in a DI policy
        are terms where they take away from the definition , they exclude and make
        exceptions . The best policies are straight forward without a lot of fluff
        when it comes to that definition . And with a disability policy , words are
        everything .
      - In order to switch from a Medicare Advantage Plan to a Medigap Plan you must
        do it during the Annual Enrollment Period which is October 15 - December 7th
        . You can contact an independent agent who can show you all the plans available
        and help match a plan to your needs . A good agent will also go over the simple
        health questions with you to make sure you qualify . Your effective date for
        the new plan will be 1/1 and that is also when you will have your old plan
        end . If you miss that window there is also a Medicare Advantage Disenrollment
        period that starts on January 1st - February 15th . A good independent agent
        will make your life a lot easier making the transition to a Medigap Plan .
      - 'That is a great question ! The definition of an annuity is '''' any stream
        of payments that has a fixed total . '''' When we use the word in our financial
        word , we are referring to an investment vehicle designed for providing a
        long lasting income stream . They are offered by insurance companies and other
        financial institutions , and are used to fund retirements , grants and trusts
        . Here ''s a very simple description of how an annuity works : They are funded
        by a deposit , which then sits for a number of years gathering interest .
        After that period of time , the annuity begins paying out a set amount until
        either it runs out , the owner dies , or the owners spouse dies , depending
        upon how the annuity is structured . It guarantees that there will be an income
        that lasts as long as you do . Because they require that the deposit sit untouched
        for many years , an annuity may not be a good investment for some people .
        That deposit money can be taken out , but there are very costly penalties
        . As a result , regulations require that the seller sit down with you first
        and do what is called a `` suitability study . '''' They will go over your
        financial situation , your retirement plans , and your goals . If it is found
        to not be `` suitable '''' for you , they can not sell you one . This protects
        folks that may have need for that cash from being trapped into a losing investment
        . I hope that answers your question for you , if you ''d like more detail
        , I ''d be happy to help , feel free to contact me , okay ? Thanks for asking

      - The best Medicare supplement plan -LRB- Medigap -RRB- plan in Florida is the
        one that fits your own needs and budget . When you consider all Medicare supplement
        insurance plans with the same letter are identical in every way except the
        premium , the decision is much easier . Medigap plan F is the most popular
        , mostly because it is oversold . Far too many agents promote the plan because
        it is easy to explain . It is also the most expensive plan and the one that
        pays the highest commission . Just last week I showed a couple in south Georgia
        how they could save over $ 1700 per year by making a simple change in coverage
        .

      - what is a SIMPLE retirement plan ? A Simple is an inexpensive opportunity
        for a small business to have a retirement plan that does n't break the bank
        in advisor fees . A Simple plan is an IRS approved plan with only a few steps
        to follow so expensive testing and record keeping are n't necessary . For

      - Social Security Disability Insurance pays a monthly benefit to people who
        can not work due to a disability . The benefit is paid in cash to the recipient
        to use as they wish ; it is not paid to an institution or entity . An injury
        or illness that causes the person to be unable to work is covered .
      - 'If you think you might qualify for Medicare due to a disability , you should
        first file for disability benefits through the Social Security Administration
        . If approved , you may be able to get Medicare prior to age 65 due to a disability
        . In order to qualify for Medicare due to a disability , you must meet the
        criteria defined by the Social Security Administration : `` Social Security
        pays only for total disability . No benefits are payable for partial disability
        or for short-term disability . `` Disability '''' under Social Security is
        based on your inability to work . We consider you disabled under Social Security
        rules if : You can not do work that you did before ; We decide that you can
        not adjust to other work because of your medical condition -LRB- s -RRB- ;
        and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year
        or to result in death '''' . You can apply for benefits through Medicare because
        of a disability online at : WEBSITELINK if you are tech savvy . If you choose
        not to apply online , you can apply at any local Social Security Administration
        office by phone or in person and you can call ahead to make an appointment
        by calling 1-800-772-1213 . If you are deaf or hearing impaired , call the
        SSA ''s toll-free TTY number , 1-800-325-0778 . Their representatives are
        available from 7AM to 7PM , Monday through Friday . It is important to note
        that this definition of disability `` is different than other programs ''''
        and `` is a strict definition of disability '''' according to the Social Security
        Administration . There are many , more comprehensive disability policies available
        which allow benefits to be paid for a partial disability , for example , or
        pay benefits to help with various expenses such as paying your mortgage in
        the event that you suffer a disability . In addition , these policies can
        be purchased for key people in a business such as a business partner or profitable
        executive . For questions regarding which disability policy may be best for
        you or how much coverage you may need , it is best to speak with an Insurance
        Professional . They are highly trained in the business of Insurance , and
        will complete a full analysis of your needs and make recommendations based
        on what ''s in your best interest . An Insurance Professional is a great resource

      - Deferring your Social Security benefit will increase your monthly benefit
        . A worker can start receiving their benefit as early as age 62 . Almost half
        of all workers elect this early date for a variety of reasons . However ,
        the Social Security Administration increases the benefit each year that you
        defer by about 8 percent . Since benefits are payable for life for many people
        this delay will result in substantially increasing their total benefit . Your
        Social Security benefits are particularly valuable . For many the decision
        to defer benefits is the most important retirement income decision than will
        make . Almost two-thirds of retirees receive over half of their income from
        Social Security . Most retirees depend upon Social Security . The Social Security
        benefit is guaranteed and inflation adjusted . Having a high inflation adjusted
        benefit is important . Inflation is a major issue in retirement . It is payable
        to a worker and a spouse should the worker die . Retirees fret over loss of
        principle and low rate of return , however , inflation is the real enemy .
        Fixed income people often call me in distress because of an increase in their
        expenses that isnt matched with an increase in income . Social Security adjusts
        the benefit annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index . The decision
        to defer impacts married couples the most . For married couples the higher
        of the two Social Security benefits is paid after the death of the first spouse
        to the surviving spouse . Because many retirees do not have guaranteed lifetime
        income deferring is the easiest way to increase that guaranteed income . With
        increased income comes greater satisfaction in retirement . Because the Social
        Security benefit is automatically adjusted for inflation it is very important
        to have the benefit set as high as possible to make the most of those adjustments
        . In fact that type of protection can rarely be purchased on the commercial
        market . This critical decision is not difficult to evaluate and implement
        . Once it is understood , deferring Social Security is really an easy strategy
        to implement . The easiest way to go about this is to just continue working
        . The worker doesnt need to remain in their current job but full or part time
        work that you love and that provides all or most of your income needs makes
        delaying Social Security quite simple . If married workers are both eligible
        for workers benefits under Social Security there are strategies that capitalize
        on the start dates . A retirement income specialist can help you work the
        math on this procedure but implementing this properly can result in a dramatic
        increase in Social Security benefits . The Social Security Administration
        also provides calculators on their website to help evaluate some of these
        approaches . There are misconceptions concerning deferral of Social Security
        benefits . As workers approach their eligibility dates they are sometimes
        distracted by a few things . The first thing is an understanding that their
        last day at work should be the same as their first day on Social Security
        . It is quite possible that that is neither true nor beneficial . The day
        that you stop work doesnt need to have any bearing on the date you start receiving
        benefits . Another misconception is that if a worker doesnt start benefits
        as early as possible they might lose out when Social Security fails . It is
        unlikely that Social Security will fail and to file early might result in
        the worker actually getting less . Some workers gamble that they will not
        live to normal life expectancy -LRB- which is the basis for most social security
        calculations . -RRB- That is an extremely poor gamble since losing puts you
        in a lower income for an even longer time if you live past life expectancy
        . Another consideration is that your spousal benefit will be much less should
        you die before your spouse . While most of the time the worker that defers
        gets a better deal and the spouse of that worker gets an increased benefit
        if they survive the worker , there are situations where not deferring the
        benefit is the best strategy . The time when that is always true is when the
        worker reaches 70 . There arent any increases available after 70 . Another
        situation where not deferring benefits would work to the advantage of the
        participant is when the worker is single and has a much less than expected
        life expectancy due to illness or injury . IF you arent in those categories
        you should at least weigh the advantages should you defer receiving benefits
        .
      - 'Before 1984 , Members of Congress received pensions that were based upon
        the Civil Service Retirement System . This is the same system used by other
        Federal employees . Members of Congress did not participate in the Social
        Security system . They were not eligible for social security benefits based
        upon their pay as Members of Congress . In 1983 Members of Congress and other
        federal employees , who were first hired after 1983 , were integrated into
        the Social Security System . Starting in 1984 all Members of Congress started
        participating in the Social Security System regardless of when they first
        entered Congress . Only those on the federal payroll prior to 1984 continue
        to participate in the Civil Service Retirement System . New Members of Congress
        since 1984 have participated in both Social Security and a new retirement
        program called the Federal Employees Retirement System . A Member of Congress
        can decline coverage in this program . Members elected prior to 1984 had the
        option of remaining on the Civil Service Retirement System or opting for the
        new Federal Employees Retirement System . The Civil Service Retirement program
        was not designed to be integrated with Social Security . The contributions
        and benefits from this program are much higher . When these benefits are combined
        with Social Security they can become substantial . Members of Congress can
        be covered under one of four different programs : 1 . Full coverage under
        Social Security and the old Civil Service Retirement System . 2 . An offset
        plan which includes both Social Security and the Civil Service Retirement
        System but the amount contributed to the CSRS is reduced by the amount paid
        into Social Security . 3 . The Federal Retirement System and Social Security
        4 . Social Security alone . The pensions for Members of Congress are financed
        through a combination of contributions from the Congressman and from the Federal
        Governmenttheir employer . When they pay Social Security payroll taxes they
        pay the standard 6.2 % required of other employees . If they remained in the
        Civil Service Retirement System they pay an additional 7 % of their pay .
        If they opted for the Federal Retirement System they pay an additional .8
        % of their pay . When they retire a Member of Congress can receive benefits
        in much the same way other federal employees do . They can file for and receive
        benefits under Social Security and they can apply for benefits under the retirement
        program they have adopted . The retirement benefit itself is based upon reaching
        at least age 62 and is a function of years of service and income in the highest
        three years of covered salary . The benefit generated under the Civil Service
        Retirement System is much greater than the benefit under the Federal Retirement
        System . By law , the benefit paid to a Member of Congress can not exceed
        eighty percent of the final pay of the Member of Congress . There are around
        500 Members of Congress drawing pensions today . Their average pension in
        2006 was under $ 35,000 . Members of Congress who elect an immediate annuity
        can also maintain the health insurance that they had as federal employees
        . Members of Congress that elect the FERS program are also eligible for a
        thrift savings program in which contributions are matched to a certain level
        .'
      - Social Security disability insurance pays benefits to you and certain members
        of your family if you have earned enough work credits to be considered ``
        insured '' . Four work credits can be earned each year . In 2014 , you receive
        one work credit for each $ 1200 of earnings , up to the yearly maximum of
        four credits . How many credits you need for disability benefits depends on
        how old you are when you are disabled . If you become disabled prior to age
        24 , you need 1 1/2 years of work -LRB- 6 credits -RRB- in the three years
        before you became disabled . For ages 24-30 , you need credits for half of
        the time between age 21 and when you became disabled . If you are 31 or older
        , you need at least 20 credits during the 10 year period preceding when you
        were disabled . Like most things associated with Social Security , it is a
        bit more complicated than this example . Remember , the worker has to have
        paid into Social Security to be qualified . There are `` survivor '' benefits
        as well . When a person who has worked and paid Social Security taxes dies
        , certain members of their family may be eligible for survivors benefits .
        Up to ten years of work is need to be eligible , depending on the person 's
        age at the time of death . A widow/widower can claim full benefits at their
        full retirement age and reduced benefits at age 60 . A disabled widow/widower
        can claim as early as age 50 . Divorced spouses under certain conditions can
        also claim survivor benefits . Unmarried children under age 18 -LRB- 19 if
        they are full time in elementary or secondary school -RRB- , some step-children
        , adopted children and grand children can also receive survivor benefits .
        There are many other situations where survivor benefits can be claimed such
        as a widow or widower of any age that takes care of a deceased person 's child
        under the age of 16 or disabled , and receiving Social Security benefits .
        Children who were disabled prior to their age 22 and remain disabled , and
        in some cases , dependent parents who are age 62 or older . As you can see
        , there are a lot of rules and regulations surrounding disability benefits
        for Social Security . Seek out someone who knows the rules .
      - Yes , disability insurance is really paycheck insurance and protects your
        income stream in the event an accident or illness prevents you from working
        . There are two type of disability insurance ; Short Term & Long Term disability
        . Short term plans usually cover periods of 13 or 26 weeks . Long Term plans
        , as their name implies , run for longer terms that can go on for years depending
        upon the policy . It is estimated that a 20 year old has a 25 % chance of
        being disabled for some period of time before they reach retirement age .
        Currently 12 % of the U.S. population is disabled with only 5 % of those disabilities
        being work related . So , a health problem or off the job accident is the
        most likely cause of someone becoming disabled . A recent report shows the
        average Social Security Disability payment is $ 1065 per month and qualifying
        for Social Security disability is famous for being difficult and time consuming
        with waits of 2 years for approval not being uncommon and as of 2009 , only
        30 % of Social Security disability claims were approved . Relying on Social
        Security alone to preserve your lifestyle in the event of a disability is
        unwise . The majority of persons who experience a disabling event can return
        to work within about 90-days . But , for persons who experience a disability
        exceeding 90-days the average length of these types of disabling events is
        3.2 years ! Ideally , a person will have both short term and long term disability
        insurance protection . Short term disability insurance will be less expensive
        and if your budget does n't allow for both coverages I would suggest starting
        out with short term coverage for the longest coverage period possible . If
        you are a female I would also recommend that you verify how a prospective
        short term disability policy treats maternity . Some policies treat maternity
        as a disabling event while others do not . This can be an important difference
        for a woman in her child bearing years .

        residents of the United States can get premium free Medicare Part A -LRB-

      - Social Security Disability Insurance is a payroll tax social program . It
        falls under the pervue of Social Security Administration . It provides income
        to people who cant work because of a disability . Social Security Disability
        can be temporary or permanent benefit . Social Security Disability does not
        depend on the income of the disabled individual receiving it .
      - Retirement , Survivors , and Disability Insurance is a reference to three
        of the benefits that Social Security pays to those who have paid into Social
        Security taxes . The `` retirement '' part refers to Social Security income
        that people get when they retire . the `` survivors '' part refers to the
        Social Security income benefits paid to dependents of a qualified deceased
        person . And the `` disability '' part refers to Social Security Disability
        benefits disabled persons receive if they are qualified .
      - If you qualify for Social Security Disability and are disabled for two years
        you will qualify for Medicare . I have many clients on Medicare and Social
        Security Disability . The key here is Social Security Disability . If you
        are collecting on a private disability policy and you are not yet on Social
        Security Disability then you can not get Medicare .
      - Medicare is available to most people , but not quite everyone . Anyone who
        has paid Social Security taxes for 40 quarters throughout their working lives
        are eligible for free Part A Medicare at age 65 , as would their spouse be
        at age 65 , whether or not they worked outside the home . Disabled persons
        are eligible for Medicare after two years of receiving Social Security Disability
        benefits . There are other categories of persons who can get Medicare , including
        some who can pay for it rather than receive Part A free . But again , not
        quite everyone in the US can get it .
      - Social Security disability benefits can generate some income during a prolonged
        sickness and/or recovery from an injury . Some employer group plans also offer
        short term disability . But if your employer does n't offer disability benefits
        , then most advisers recommend having at least short term disability insurance
        if you ca n't afford long term disability premiums .
      - Your current medical history does n't affect whether or not you would qualify
        for Medicare . In general , you must be 65 years or older to sign up for Medicare
        Part A & Part B . At age 62 , you would not be able to qualify for Medicare
        as you 're too young for the program - the only exception is if you are receiving
        social security disability benefits for more than 24 continuous months . If
        you 're receiving social security disability benefits , but have not met the
        24 month rule , then you would not be eligible for Medicare . Please note
        , when you 're new to Medicare Part A and Part B , you activate a 6-month
        initial open enrollment period to also buy a Medicare Supplement plan -LRB-
        also known as a Medigap plan -RRB- with NO medical underwriting - meaning
        even with hep C , you can get one . This is the best time to buy a Medigap
        plan . After your initial open enrollment period expires , you would be subject
        to medical questions for any Medigap plan . I hope the information is helpful
        - please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need help with
        your Medicare Supplement coverage - you can reach me via the `` contact me
        '' button next to my picture . Thanks very much .
      - I am not aware of any insurance carrier that will write life insurance without
        a social security number . All most all want proof of citizenship and they
        want to know the beneficiaries social security numbers as well . Our government
        does keep track of money even though life insurance proceeds are not taxable
        as income .
      - Short term disability insurance is paycheck protection in case of a disability
        event . And many consumers can only afford short term disability versus long
        term disability coverage . Mutual of Omaha is a major carrier in short term
        disability insurance . Keep in mind that you may have short term disability
        insurance through your employers group benefit plan . You also have Social
        Security disability insurance , although benefits may be limited .
      - Life insurance does not affect Social Security Disability Benefits , however
        it may impact eligibility for Supplemental Security Income -LRB- SSI -RRB-
        . SSI is needs based . Applicants with resources totaling two thousand dollars
        or more are not eligible . Cash value life insurance policies do count towards
        that total . Term life does not have cash value and would not be a factor
        .
      - There are several ways to qualify for Medicare . The most obvious is to reach
        age 65 and have worked ten years during which you paid the Medicare tax .
        You must reside in the United States or its territories . You can also qualify
        for Medicare if you are disabled and receiving benefits under Social Security
        or the Railroad Retirement Board . You can also qualify if you have End Stage
        Renal Disease -LRB- ESRD -RRB- or Lou Gehrigs disease ALS . If you 're getting
        disability income from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board -LRB-
        RRB -RRB- , youre eligible for Medicare Part A -LRB- Hospital Insurance -RRB-
        and Part B -LRB- Medical Insurance -RRB- starting the 25th month you get the
        benefits . In those cases your enrollment will be automatic . There are exceptions
        which may apply to you and you should consult with Medicare about your situation
        . There isnt coverage if you are outside the USA or are in jail or prison
        .
      - Disability insurance pays a monthly income -LRB- generally tax free -RRB-
        and covers prolonged sickness and/or recovery from an injury . The payments
        start after the elimination or waiting period has been satisfied . It 's important
        to secure and maintain disability coverage because fundamentally it 's paycheck
        protection beyond the basic stipend of Social Security disability benefits
        .
      - 'Medicare is not optional to start at age 62 , as Social Security is . You
        can only get it at age 65 unless there is another reason for getting it before
        age 65 . Those reasons are : having end stage renal disease , being on Social
        Security Disability for 24 months , or having Lou Gehrig ''s Disease .'
      - You can get on Medicare at age 65 . This is regardless of when you choose
        to collect your Social Security benefits . You can get on Medicare at a younger
        age if you have been receiving Social Security Disability benefits for two
        years , or have ALS or ESRD , in some cases .
      labels:
      - Social Security Disability Insurance pays a monthly benefit to people who
        can not work due to a disability . The benefit is paid in cash to the recipient
        to use as they wish ; it is not paid to an institution or entity . An injury
        or illness that causes the person to be unable to work is covered .

      label_candidates:
      - Yes , automobile insurance is typically paid in advance . Normally no less
        than thirty days at a time . Each carrier sets their own requirements as to
        the initial payment amount for new coverage . Most carriers allow clients
        to pay monthly , quarterly , semi-annually , or annually . If you pay your
        premium in full for semi-annual or annual you may also receive a discount
        on your rate -LRB- this is solely at the discretion of the carrier -RRB- .
      - The right kind of life insurance can be used to cover a funeral . Do n't count
        on paying for your funeral with term life insurance or insurance through your
        employer . The term will usually end before you die . The employer insurance
        is not a good plan for funeral planning because most people live to retirement
        age which is after the employer insurance ends . For funeral planning either
        buy a prepaid funeral plan from a funeral home or make sure you have at least
        10,000 of guaranteed whole-life insurance . Either of those will work fine
        .
      - 'Life insurance can affect SSI if it exceeds the resource limit . What IS
        allowed in life insurance : Policy or policies with combined face amount of
        $ 1,500 -LRB- if married , $ 1,500 for each spouse -RRB- $ 1,500 prepaid burial
        fund -LRB- if married , one for each spouse -RRB- If the person or couple
        with the burial fund also has life insurance , some of the burial fund may
        count toward the $ 2,000 limit for an individual or $ 3,000 limit for a married
        couple .'
      - Typically , homeowner 's insurance , like most insurance coverage is prepaid
        . That is , you receive your bill for a year , six months or whichever billing
        mode you have selected , and it is paid . Your policy is then effective until
        it is cancelled and of course , you will receive subsequent billing notices
        . Ahomeowner ` sinsurance policy can be paid by a mortgage company if it is
        escrowed .
      - 'Homeowners Insurance is in fact paid in advance ; this is not specific to
        home insurance ; insurance is a prepaid service of security . However , depending
        on the insurance carrier , you will most probably be offered multiple payment
        plans spanning from Annual to Monthly payments . There are few carriers that
        specifically offer a ` Paid In Full '' discount for those that prepay the
        annual premium ; if you bump into one of these plans only with select carriers
        , it would be well worth going with that plan even if the policy premium is
        slightly greater . You may review options at : WEBSITELINK'
      - Most people will receive Medicare Part A at no charge . If you have worked
        in the Social Security system at least 40 quarters you have prepaid for your
        Part A coverage . Part B is optional -LRB- but highly recommended -RRB- and
        current runs $ 105 per month for most people . Your Part B premium is usually
        deducted from your Social Security check .
      - Everyone can `` benefit '' from having life insurance but not everyone ``
        needs '' life insurance . If you are lifelong single , have no debts , have
        prepaid all your final expenses -LRB- funeral , cemetery , cremation -RRB-
        no dependents what so ever , have no charities , people or organizations that
        you want to transfer money to upon your death ... you have the least need
        for life insurance . But even then you could benefit from the tax-free cash
        accumulation of a dividend paying whole life policy . You just have to assess
        you wants and goals and measure them against the cost .
      - The principle of insurance is that premiums are paid before coverage begins
        and claims are paid when it ends . Of course , it doesnt always work exactly
        like that but homeowners policies are always prepaid . If this is the first
        policy you are buying on a home you have just purchased the title company
        will take the initial premium out of the closing unless you can show proof
        that it is has already been paid .
      - 'Yes . Keep in mind that when you change ownership you lose all control of
        the policy and turn it over to the new owner . Make sure you have a solid
        reason for doing so . Some common practices would include : Making a funeral
        home the owner and beneficiary so that the funeral can be prepaid , assigning
        ownershio to a Funeral Trust , assigning ownership to a trusted family member
        . There are other reasons but again remember that you lose control over the
        policy .'
      - Yes and 88-year-old can buy life insurance . But he will have to be an unusually
        healthy 88-year-old . He will also have to be willing to pay a very high premium
        if he 's setting up a monthly payment . He is not expected to live for too
        many years and wo n't have too long to pay premiums so that results in a much
        higher premium . If the 88-year-old is in bad health he can always set up
        a prepaid funeral insurance policy through a funeral home .
      - That is a great question ! It is n't so much the number of doors , as it is
        the make and model of the car . A sports car is generally going to be more
        expensive to insure than a station wagon , typically because of the way they
        are driven . Statistically , the sports car will be more likely to be involved
        in an accident or garner traffic violations , than the pedestrian , family
        car . The sports car will typically be more expensive than the average family
        sedan also , making the premiums higher . That is what will cost you , not
        the number of doors , so much . Thanks for asking !
      - Auto insurance follows the car not the driver or occupant . If your child
        is unlicensed and operating the car , the provisions of the policy would remain
        in effect . If your child is an occupant in the car and is hurt in an accident
        for which the driver of your car is at fault , there can be limited coverage
        for his medical care . If the driver of the other car is determined to be
        at fault your childs medical cost will ultimately be paid by the other driver
        . If your child is struck by a motor vehicle while a pedestrian there can
        be limited medical coverage .
      - If you have physical damage coverage on your insurance policy and the car
        is damaged in an accident , the company might declare the car a total loss
        . When the company does that they will offer to pay you the market value of
        the car minus the deductible . This is an offer which you can refuse and accept
        a lesser amount for repairs . If you are able to repair the car and continue
        the car in service that is an option you can take . You should be given a
        choice .
      - Depending on the specific terms and conditions of your policy , it might ,
        but you need to talk this over with your Insurance Professional . Most policies
        settle losses on an `` Actual Cash Value '' or `` Depreciated Value '' basis
        meaning that settlement for a total loss would be based upon the book value
        of the car . Some companies offer optional new car replacement coverage which
        would then pay for a new car of similar make and model . Other policies ,
        usually covering collector or classic cars will pay based upon an agreed value
        for the car , in many cases predetermined by an appraisal at the time of application
        .
      - -- > Normal 0 I feel its important to add to this discussion that should you
        be driving someone elses car with their permission and be involved in an accident
        , the car owners insurance would be primary -LRB- first to pay -RRB- but insurance
        coverage you carry on your car , if you have one , would be excess . In other
        words , if your limits were greater than those covering the borrowed car or
        your coverage were broader , your coverage should be available once the car
        owners limits are exhausted .
      - I am not sure exactly what you mean by this question . My thoughts are that
        you are referring to a policy that will pay the excess amount if your car
        is totaled and you still owe more than the car is worth . For example , you
        owe $ 25000 on your car and it is totaled . The insurance company pays the
        book , which is $ 20,000 . Under some polices you are still on the hook for
        the balance , even though you no longer have the car . A policy that includes
        excess would pay off the car completely .
      - Most states have a requirement that if the damages exceed a percentage -LRB-
        usually 70 % to 80 % -RRB- the car must be totalled . I have never heard of
        a car being repaired `` because of low mileage '' . At what point is the chasis
        bent and just because a car has low mileage has no bearing on how the car
        will perform if it is repaired . If the chasis is bent it is to your best
        interest that love affair ends because the cost of trying to keeptires on
        a car with abent chasis will keep youin a losing proposition
      - This can vary of course , but generally speaking , and insurance company will
        determine a car to be a `` total loss '' if the amount of money needed to
        repair the damage exceeds the value of the car . A good rule of thumb is that
        if say the cost to repair your car is in the neighborhood of 70 % of the ``
        book value '' of that car , it is more likely that the company will total
        it . This is because in most cases , all of the possible damage can not be
        identified until the car starts being torn down .
      - If your car is declared a total loss you will be offered a settlement for
        the value of the car minus the deductible -LRB- if you were at fault . -RRB-
        Frequently you will be given the option to retain ownership in the car for
        a negotiated amount . If you then have the car restored , the licensed car
        will have a salvage or C title . The settlement is negotiated between you
        and the insurance company . Make sure that you understand all the options
        and assert your position if it is necessary .
      - In most states you are required to be financially responsible in order to
        operate a car on the public roads . Being financially responsible means own
        auto insurance on the car for most people . It is possible to purchase a car
        and never drive it , some collectors do that . So the key is not in buying
        a car but in operating it . Dont forget that in most states the registered
        owner is the one who will be held responsible for anything that happens .
        To protect themselves auto dealers frequently require evidence of insurance
        before allowing the car to leave the sales lot .
