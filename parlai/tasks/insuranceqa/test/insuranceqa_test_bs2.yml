      - do I need Disability Insurance outside of my group plan be an excellent question
        the answer without look at your policy be maybe here be why most of the group
        plan I see fall into 1 2 category the first be short term disability , the
        second be long term disability coverage in many case the employer will offer
        both but the employee only opt into 1 or the other if you have short term
        Di then my question be what happen if you be still disable after that period
        which may only be up to 90 day less if you have long-term Di which kick in
        after 6 month 12 month , etc. what be you go do before you start get a benefit
        last statistically we know people today will have 7 + job in there lifetime
        this mean depend where you be if you leave your job whether voluntarily not
        these benefit do not follow you so consider get something in place at minimum
        so you be not leave hanging in the event of job loss remember Di can only
        be apply for if you have a job if you be not working then you will not be
        able get Disability Insurance if you be unemployed have a Di policy , get
        disabled , then you will still receive a benefit not a bad deal in this situation

        consider doing
      - judge by the billboard and advertisement cheap insurance be readily available
        many state have special program that provide limited cheap auto insurance
        the thing remember be when you be in an accident , these cheap insurer may
        treat you the same way and you may not appreciate that
      - great question depend upon the company you be use the unfortunate answer be
        usually yes some company however offer accident forgiveness benefit for people
        who have not make a claim previously so I will advise you check with your
        agent first before file and see if that be available for you another thing
        think about be the cost of the repair itself - will it be equal to or less
        than your deductible if so you will pay that much anyway it may not make sense
        make the claim and risk the increase in your premium if you need any help
