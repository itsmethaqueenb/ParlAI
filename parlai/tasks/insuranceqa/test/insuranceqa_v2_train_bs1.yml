    - Aside from the obvious dangerous loss of coverage , you may have problems with
      your Mortgage Company . If you have a mortgage and your insurance cancels ,
      it is likely that you will receive a letter asking you to provide proof of coverage
      . If none is provided , it is likely that the mortgage company will obtain coverage
      on your home in THEIR interest and pass on the cost to you through your monthly
      mortgate payments . If you had been paying your insurance provider $ 1000 a
      year , you can expect that the mortgage company insurance policy will run you
      substantially more than that , say $ 3,000 . And remember , it covers their
      interest , not yours .
    - Universal life policies are somewhat tricky . What happens when you cancel a
      universal life policy depends on when you cancel the policy . In the beginning
      years of a UL it has no cash value accumulated , so if you cancel during that
      stage nothing happens other than the policy terminates . You get no money back
      . In the mid range years of the policy it will likely have some cash value ,
      so if you cancel it during that period you may receive the cash value . In the
      later years of a UL , unless you have kept pace with the increasing `` cost
      of insurance '' , -LRB- in other words paid increasingly higher premiums -RRB-
      , the cash value that has accumulated may be reduced by they increasing cost
      of insurance until there is no more cash value remaining . At that point the
      policy may terminate . So if you cancel the policy while it has cash value you
      will receive the cash value . If there is no cash value when you cancel the
      policy it will simply terminate .
    - I ca n't imagine why you would want to just cancel your Whole Life insurance
      policy ! You know that you have the option of replacing your current policy
      with another policy and have all the value of the current policy transferred
      to the new policy ? However as you asked what happens when you cancel a whole
      life policy - what happens is you no longer have the insurance . If the policy
      has grown sufficient cash value to cover the surrender fees and have an excess
      , you should be able to receive the remaining cash value at the time of cancellation
      . You really should talk with a qualified Insurance Adviser and find out what
      your options are and then decide how to proceed .
    - 'Not normally . Your home insurance was designed to repair or replace your home
      if something covered happens to it . Usually , anything below ground is n''t
      covered . Now , if your home is destroyed and the insurance company rebuilds
      your home , they will usually pay to hook your sewer up , but not to repair
      or replace the pipes . if you think about the things that can happen to a home
      , a sewer pipe really ca n''t have those things happen to it . My big question
      here is : what the heck happened to your sewer pipes that you want covered ?
      Insurance is designed to repair damage that is sudden and accidental . There
      are n''t many things you can do to a sewer pipe that are sudden and accidental
      . About the only thing I can think of is if someone working underground hits
      a sewer pipe and breaks it . In this case the company working there is responsible
      for any damage they may cause .'
    - I ca n't think of a situation where it would n't be required . Your mortgage
      company has just lent you a bunch of money to buy a home . They need to be sure
      that , if something happens to the home , it will be restored to what it was
      before anything happened . They 're just protecting their investment . The bigger
      question is `` why would n't you want to insure your home ? '' . You just made
      a big commitment and have a lot of money on the line . If something happened
      to your home , what would you do ? Yes , premiums for homeowners insurance are
      high , but not as high as the repairs you 'd have to pay for if you did n't
      have insurance . Plus , it not only protects the house , but everything in the
      house . Most people do n't think they have a lot of money tied up in their ``
      things '' , but they 'd be astonished to find out what it would cost to replace
      it all .
    - When you cancel your life insurance , what happens will depend on what type
      of policy you have . If you have Term Life insurance , the policy will simply
      end . You will not get any money back unless you had ROP Term -LRB- Return of
      Premium Term -RRB- and had kept the policy long enough that you are eligible
      to receive back part of the premiums you paid in . If you have a Permanent Life
      insurance policy that accumulated cash value , you will be able to receive the
      surrender value in cash . If you want to quit paying on your Permanent policy
      but do n't necessarily want to cancel your insurance , you could roll the surrender
      value over into another life insurance policy . Or you may have the option to
      change your policy to a reduced paid up policy , which means that it will be
      a smaller policy but you will not have to make any more payments to it . If
      you cancel a permanent policy in the first years , there will be a surrender
      charge that will reduce the cash value , and if you have loans against the policy
      , those will also be deducted from what you receive from the cash value , along
      with interest on the loans . You can request a current illustration to see what
      your Whole Life or Universal Life has for cash value , surrender charges and
      loan charges .
    - This is a very relevant question because there is not a black-and-white answer
      to it . Lets suppose you have a family where mom does stay at home with the
      kids . Tragically , she dies . What is the best possible thing that can happen
      with these kids ? Really , its for dad to stay home with them . Theyve already
      lost mom . They are going to need their dad more than they ever have . He is
      THE parent . Dad may want to keep working and hire a Mary Poppins-type nanny
      , but that is the second best solution by far . He really should stay home from
      work to the greatest extent possible and just connect and bond and nurture and
      comfort these kids through what may be the most devastating occurrence in their
      life . Obviously , he will need money to be able to afford to stay home . That
      is what I think is the number one function of life insurance on a stay-at-home
      mom . This is a hard sell to insurance companies these days , because they keep
      thinking in terms of percentage of the wager earners coverage , and on and on
      . But if I get a couple who really want dad to stay home if the family does
      lose mom , I fight hard to get them a policy to make that happen .
    - 'Years ago , it was n''t all that uncommon to see a $ 100 deductible . Those
      days are gone . Today , our standard deductible is $ 500 but I sell more deductibles
      of $ 1.000 and $ 2,500 . There ''s a reason for this . In the past , say around
      25 years ago , a homeowners policy was very basic and really only covered your
      home and contents with a few other ancillary coverages . The consumer was different
      , also . They usually only filed a claim for something big like a fire or tornado
      . About 20 years ago or so , insurance companies thought it would be a good
      idea to add more coverages for smaller things like refrigerated food and others
      . Then , a strange thing happened : People started claiming these things . You
      see , big claims like fires are very infrequent and the rates were built around
      these rarely occurring , big losses . They were n''t prepared for the more frequent
      small losses . Therefore , a $ 100 deductible on a total loss does n''t add
      much to the claim . However , insurance companies began seeing a lot of smaller
      claims and , now , that $ 100 deductible made it beneficial to the consumer
      to claim that $ 400 loss . In fact , they became so frequent that it was really
      hurting the insurance companies profitability . Every claim requires people
      to process it , adjust it , and make a payment . Insurance companies were seeing
      these costs skyrocket and they had no choice but to raise premiums to offset
      these costs . They finally reached a point where they had to discourage all
      these small losses . The way they did it ? they made the $ 100 and $ 250 deductible
      options a lot more expensive . So now , a $ 500 deductible is pretty standard
      , with higher deductibles saving quite a bit off the premiums . What does this
      mean for you ? First , realize that your homeowners policy was designed to cover
      the catastrophic losses , not the small things that happen more often . In Michigan
      , if you have 3 claims in a 3 year period that are n''t weather-related , your
      company can cancel your policy . This will leave you in a spot where you may
      have to pay 3 or 4 times the premium your used to until you ''re eligible again
      . A homeowners policy is not a maintenance contract . As a homeowner , things
      are going to happen and the responsibility for maintaining your home is yours
      . My advice is this : Take care of your home and pay for the small things and
      take a higher deductible . You ''ll probably save more before you have claim
      than the difference in the deductible . In the long run , you ''ll be protected
      against the big things and you ''ll have more money in your pocket .'
    - It may be possible for a car insurance company to `` short rate '' your requested
      cancellation which means that they would retain a certain small percentage above
      and beyond what has been fully earned for the term and refund you the balance
      . That had been a more common practice years ago but for the most part , that
      does n't happen too much any more . For the most part , your policy would be
      cancelled as requested and the appropriate refund of any pre paid premium returned
      to you without any additional charge . Naturally , the amount of refund would
      be determined by the amount you had pre paid or the term and where you happen
      to be in that term .
    - What happens when you cancel life insurance ? You end your coverage on the date
      you provide . Any cash values or unused premium in your policy will be returned
      to you . With term insurance any unused premium will be refunded . Cancelation
      should be done in writing as cancelation often requires a signed document .
    - This is a difficult question to answer without viewing your specific policy
      and the coverages contained in it . Is a water heater covered within a policy
      , generally yes . It just depends on what happens . For example , general wear
      and tare is not covered under the standard homeowners policy ; however , if
      you adding coverage for appliances or household items -LRB- that would have
      cost you more each year -RRB- or you pay for a home warranty , it could be covered
      for wear and tare . If the damage is from a busted pipe that occurred by no
      fault of your own or was from a power surge , it could be protected if the policy
      is setup correctly . It does come down to what exactly you have your policy
      and within the policy what the limits are . If you have a home warranty program
      that is always the best way to go because claims with the warranty companies
      will not result in higher premiums for your homeowners policy , but if you take
      a claim against your homeowners for the coverage -LRB- EVEN if it is n't covered
      -RRB- it could result in a slight increase in your prices for next year . If
      the cost is less than your deductible it would n't benefit you to make a claim
      on the home policy either .
    - Insurance is voluntary in that it can always be cancelled . The best time to
      cancel a policy is when it is up for renewal . At that time insurance companies
      know that most customers shop for better policies/better rates and it is expected
      that some policies will be cancelled . If you cancel at the right time there
      is no further premium payment obligation on the insured .
    - Depending on your states laws . They have to give you 45 day notice in Montana
      and the can if you fraudulently put information on your application they can
      there are many reasons why they can . In many cases they Non renew you When
      you get an auto policy in most states it clearly states that you must list all
      drivers that regularly dive your auto and if you do n't then that is fraud and
      they can also use that to cancel on a Home if there is more of a risk then it
      is possible or 2 many claims there numerous factors that would apply contact
      a local agent and find out why there are many things that they can do to prevent
      this from happening
    - In order to drive a vehicle in many States , the law requires a licensed driver
      to be insured ! If the driver does not own a vehicle , a policy form is available
      by the name of ` Named Non-Owner ' Insurance ; this insurance provides liability
      and optional uninsured motorist coverage for the named insured driving a vehicle
      not titled in his/her name . If you have a Named Non-Owner Insurance policy
      , the carrier upon request will issue an SR-22 endorsement to the Governing
      State Department of Motor Vehicles . In the event that the insurance is cancelled
      , an SR-26 cancellation form is issued and sent to the Governing Department
      in order to confirm cancellation of the insurance thus cancelling the SR-22
      . If one does not desire to purchase the insurance and is merely attempting
      to get a Form SR-22 issued , there is no method to do so without keeping active
      insurance for the term that the SR-22 is required . The SR-22 is simply a reporting
      form confirming continuous coverage . Many States now require electronic reporting
      between insurance carriers and the State Department of Motor Vehicles .
    - Home Insurance can be changed at any time . A homeowner can cancel his or her
      insurance at any time and purchase a policy from another carrier . The unearned
      portion of paid premium will be returned to the Insured in an expeditious manner
      . A bank or mortgage company is not permitted to require a homeowner to purchase
      insurance from any specific insurance company . For homes not insurable under
      Preferred Home Insurance Programs , there are some Sub-Standard Programs which
      will accept homes which are not in the best of repair or which are declared
      a high risk to carriers , in the absence of an insurance market for the home
      , most States have a Fair Plan which will accept the risk sometimes on a Fire
      Only basis . There is a link available providing an online format to obtain
      a quote and buy home insurance online in multiple States ; it may be used by
      Escrow/Closing Professionals , Mortgage Professionals , Real Estate Agents and
      directly by Consumers . An exemplary online experience for all ! WEBSITELINK
    - It depends on your home policy , and what happened to the laptop . Your home
      policy protects your property against certain risks . If your laptop was stolen
      you may have coverage , but if you dropped it or spilled a drink on it that
      would not be covered on your home policy . In most cases though , your deductible
      is going to exceed the value of the laptop regardless of what caused the loss
      . Furthermore , you should try and protect your loss history . If your decuctible
      is $ 1,000 and it costs $ 1,200 to replace the laptop , your compensation will
      only be $ 200 . This may not be worth filing the claim as you may lose discounts
      for a clean loss history and the increased cost of insurance may not be worth
      it .
    - A homeowners policy can always be cancelled for non-payment of premium . In
      addition to the representations made to the agent , the underwriter also can
      order an on-site inspection . If the property isnt as described the policy can
      be cancelled . Some specific issues might be the presence of an aggressive dog
      , or poor maintenance of the home or grounds . Mortgage companies also report
      to insurance companies when a residence is vacant . The insurance company is
      likely to cancel the homeowners policy .
    - 'Under certain conditions , Medicare Part A will cover intermittent or part-time
      home health care provided by a skilled nurse . Again , Medicares requirements
      for receiving home care are quite strict . Medicare will pay for home health
      care to treat an illness or injury only if a person meetsallof the following
      requirements : - A doctor must determine that medical care is needed at home
      and must make a plan for such care . - The person needs intermittent skilled
      nursing care , physical therapy , speech therapy , or occupational therapy .
      - The person is homebound , which means generally unable to leave home -LRB-
      when a person leaves , it must be infrequent and for a short time only , such
      as to go to a doctors appointment -RRB- . - The home health care agency must
      be Medicare-approved . Keep in mind that unlike Medicares nursing home benefit
      , a person does not need to be admitted to a hospital first in order to qualify
      for Medicare home health care . In addition , services will be provided on an
      intermittent or part-time basis only by a visiting nurse , therapist , or home
      health aide . Medicares home health care benefit does not pay for 24-hour full-time
      care . Medicare generally limits its home health care benefit because the program
      is only designed to serve individuals who need intermittent care for a relatively
      short period of time rather than care on a daily basis . Once a person is receiving
      Medicare home health care , his or her plan of care will be reviewed at least
      every 60 days . If the persons health changes and care is no longer needed ,
      the home health agency will notify the individuals doctor , who must then contact
      Medicare . From that point , home care will no longer be covered by Medicare
      . The Medicare home health care benefit will not pay for homemaker services
      such as housekeeping , shopping , and cleaning . It also does not pay for custodial
      carethat is , help with meeting daily personal needs such as bathing , toileting
      , transferring , or eating . Because most people who need long-term care need
      custodial care , financial practitioners should point out this shortcoming to
      clients . Many people who do qualify for Medicare home health care benefits
      still need to pay for additional custodial care in order to live comfortably
      and independently at home .'

    - You can cancel an automobile policy whenever you wish . The insurance company
      will notifythe DMV . The company will refund unused premium in one of two ways
      . Some companies still use `` short-rate '' cancellation which imposes a penalty
      for cancelling before the policy term ends . Most companies use `` pro-rata
      '' cancellation which charges just for the number of days coverage is in force
      .

    - A qualified plan is generally a government approved define benefit or defined
      contribution retirement plan . It is generally has a pretax or tax deductible
      privilege for the plan participant and accumulates tax deferred . Non-qualified
      plans are not tax deductible , but do accumulate tax deferred with annuities
      and/or life insurance .
    - No , the retirement plan offered by the military is not qualified . Public sector
      pension plans are not covered by ERISA -LRB- Employee Retirement Income Security
      Act -RRB- , and in order for a retirement plan to be qualified , it must meet
      the regulations set forth by ERISA . Therefore , the military 's retirement
      plan offered through the federal government is nonqualified .
    - The service addresses both ERISA qualified plans and other nonqualified supplemental
      retirement plans . Assuming this question is addressing ERISA qualified plans
      , there are several retirement plans such as the popular 401 -LRB- k -RRB- ,
      403 -LRB- b -RRB- and 412 -LRB- i -RRB- as well as others such as cash balance
      plans defined benefit plans , defined contribution plans , profit sharing plans
      .
    - Cash value life insurance products are frequently used as a retirement planning
      vehicle . Most nonqualified retirement plans , from the largest to the smallest
      companies in America , use life insurance to informally fund the retirement
      payments companies make to their retiring executives . So , it would stand to
      reason that what works for those arrangements can work for individuals , too
      ! With the right products , an experienced life insurance professional can design
      a supplemental retirement plan using life insurance to provide income in retirement
      , tax free -LRB- through policy loans -RRB- . Whole life is not always the best
      choice in terms of efficiency and flexibility . Universal life based products
      are better , in my experience .
    - Section 457 plans are nonqualified deferred compensation plans available only
      to state and local government employers , and nongovernment organizations exempt
      from tax under IRC Section 501 . Generally 457 plans are utilized for two reasons
      - 1 . As deferred compensation plans that allow participants to reduce their
      taxable salary in a manner similar to that of 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans . 401
      -LRB- k -RRB- plans generally are not available to state and local government
      organizations . 2 . As supplemental benefit plans that provide executives with
      supplemental retirement income .
    - Bank owned life insurance -LRB- BOLI -RRB- allows banks to obtain better after
      tax return on assets than tier 1 capital . The bank is owner and beneficiary
      of the life insurance , not bank executives . Regulations have tightened in
      recent years and banks must have a legitimate reason to own life insurance on
      the lives of highly compensated executives of the bank . BOLI is usually set
      up to informally fund nonqualified benefit plans for selected executives . The
      executive is an insured in these policies but has no ownership interest . The
      executive 's family not a beneficiary of the policy though the nonqualified
      benefit agreements may have death benefit provisions which are income taxable
      to them unlike a life insurance policy death benefit . Though not BOLI , split
      dollar arrangements have reemerged which can overcome most BOLI shortcomings
      and allow both the bank and the executive to directly participate in and benefit
      from a life insurance contract .
    - In qualified retirement plans , it may make sense to annuitize the annuity before
      required minimum distributions become mandatory . In nonqualified retirement
      planning strategies , you may want to use the staggering annuity product tactic
      called annuity laddering to maximized tax deferral and utilize the combination
      of different annuities along you retirement timeline .
    - The corporation is either the total or partial beneficiary on the policy , and
      an employee or group of employees , owner or debtor is listed as the insured
      -LRB- s -RRB- . Fundamentally , COLI differs from group life insurance policies
      that are typically offered to most or all of the employees in a company , because
      this type of insurance is designed to protect the employees and their families
      and not the company itself . COLI can be structured in many different ways to
      accomplish many different objectives . One of the most common is to fund certain
      types of nonqualified plans , such as a split-dollar life insurance policy that
      allows the company to recoup its premium outlay into the policy by naming itself
      as the beneficiary for the amount of premium paid , with the remainder going
      to the employee who is the insured on the policy . Other forms of COLI include
      key person life insurance that pays the company a death benefit upon the death
      of a key employee , and buy-sell agreements that fund the buyout of a deceased
      partner or owner of a business . In many cases , the death benefit is used to
      buy some or all of the shares of company stock owned by the deceased -LRB- such
      as with a closely-held business -RRB- . COLI is also frequently used as a means
      of recovering the cost of funding various types of employee benefits .
    - Generally speaking , if the annuity is nonqualified , the beneficiary of an
      annuity will pay taxes on the earnings . The basis , or monetary contribution
      that purchased the annuity , is not taxed . How the beneficiary is taxed depends
      on whether they receive the annuity in a lump sum or whether they annuitize
      it -LRB- take periodic payments -RRB- . If the annuity was tax qualified when
      purchased , taxes are paid on both the basis -LRB- original contribution -RRB-
      and the earnings .
    - A life insurance retirement plan is a nonqualified , tax deferred cash value
      accumulating policy . To maximize the accumulating cash values , the policy
      must be designed with lowest cost of insurance death benefit option non modified
      endowment contract . The contract death benefit and death benefit options must
      be managed throughout the life on the insurance to minimize the cost of insurance
      . There are several crediting methods available depending upon your risk tolerance
      . If the contract is designed correctly , the policy can generate tax free withdrawals

    - The similarity between a Roth IRA and a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan is that they
      are both qualified retirement plans . The Internal Revenue Service has issued
      regulations on both and they appear in the Code . The number 401 -LRB- k -RRB-
      is the code section that permits that specific type of retirement program .
      In both programs the income tax on earnings from money held in the program is
      tax-deferred , meaning that there isnt any income tax on the earnings in the
      current year . A Roth IRA is an individual plan . You own the plan . The money
      that you put into the plan is made with money that has already been taxed .
      You dont need to be the employee of a particular company to have a Roth IRA
      . There isnt any tax current tax deduction for the deposit . You can have a
      Roth IRA even if you have a retirement plan elsewhere . As a plan owner you
      select where the funds are to be invested , within limits . There are adjusted
      gross income limits to participation so check with your advisor if you have
      relatively high income . A non-working spouse can have a Roth IRA . A 401 -LRB-
      k -RRB- is an employer sponsored plan . Your employer sets up the plan and either
      administers the plan directly or uses a third party administrator to maintain
      the plan . Under most circumstances the employer states clearly who can participate
      in the plan . The money contributed to the plan is normally deducted from your
      paycheck before income tax is withheld . That is because that money is tax-deferred
      . There wont be any current income tax on that money . Sometimes employers will
      match some of the money contributed as an incentive . Particularly when the
      employer contributes to the plan there will probably be a vesting schedule .
      That means that the money contributed by the employer isnt really yours until
      you meet a certain criteria for service or participation in the plan . The plan
      will also stipulate whether in-service withdrawals can be made , and the conditions
      under which they can be made . During the accumulation phase withdrawals from
      a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan can trigger a taxable event . However , with a Roth
      IRA if the program has been in place for more than five years and you are older
      than 59.5 , or have become disabled or need the money for a first-time home
      purchase , there isnt a penalty tax of 10 % . You can also use the money for
      higher education costs . Withdrawals for education prior to your reaching age
      59.5 will be subject to income tax even though they are not subject to the additional
      10 % penalty tax . You can withdraw up to the total of your payments without
      income tax or the additional 10 % penalty tax . Treatment can be different under
      a 401 -LRB- k. -RRB- The plan itself might not allow in-service withdrawals
      and income tax and penalty could also be charged . During the accumulation phase
      the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan will offer a limited number of investment options
      , often including an option to purchase company stock . Those are the only investment
      options available . However , a Roth IRA can be funded with a variety of investments
      and changed whenever it is deemed best by you . When you retire with a 401 -LRB-
      k -RRB- the IRS will require that starting after you reach 70.5 you must make
      withdrawals every year . These are scheduled in the code . With a 401 -LRB-
      k -RRB- these withdrawals are treated as ordinary income and are fully taxed
      . This is not a requirement of your Roth IRA . Withdrawals are not required
      and when you decide to take them , they are free of income tax if you are over
      59.5 years old . You can name a beneficiary with both types of plans ; however
      with the Roth IRA if the plan has been held for more than five years , the funds
      can pass to an heir tax-free . The key issue is that deposits in a 401 -LRB-
      k -RRB- are currently not included in your income tax and may be matched by
      your employer . The contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars
      . When you retire all of the money in your 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan will be taxed
      as withdrawn as ordinary income , however , none of the money from a Roth IRA
      will be taxed .
    - A retirement plan can be qualified defined benefit or contribution plan or a
      non-qualified plan . If your tax bracket is high you may select a qualified
      plan with pretax contributions as an example . Funding your retirement plan
      with saving and investment products will depend on your personal financial profile
      that should include a risk assessment analysis and timeline that benchmark your
      retirement date and life expectancy .
    - 'Retirement planning can be seem overwhelming since it involves so many different
      issues . The most difficult part for most is clarifying what do you want your
      retirement to look like . Travel , hobbies , charity work , new work ? The point
      is , once you have clarified your objectives , you can work on the `` financials
      '''' . How much do you need to accumulate ? What vehicles work best ? What about
      tax ? If you have further questions , or feel that I could be of assistance
      , please do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like to work with a local
      Retirement Planner , you could start with a Google search . For example , if
      you search for : retirement planner Halifax or retirement planning Halifax ,
      my name , along with several others , will come up . You can use the same method
      to find Retirement Planners in your community .'
    - First create a financial profile that includes your timeline to retirement ,
      your life expectancy , your tax bracket and your risk tolerance . Estimating
      timelines will help you frame your retirement planning . Knowing your tax bracket
      will help you decide whether to use a qualified or non qualified retirement
      plan . Determining your risk tolerance will also help your select the right
      investment product . You need to discover if your employer sponsors a retirement
      plan , especially if it offers matching contributions . This can help you decide
      whether to use an individual or employer sponsored retirement plan .
    - You need to determine your tax bracket , your risk tolerance , your contributions
      , how long will you work and what is your life expectancy ? This will help you
      in your selection between a qualified or non-qualified plan . It will also assist
      you in the product selection based on your time horizon and risk thresholds
      . If you 're an individual you may consider an IRA or a Roth IRA . If your employer
      sponsors a defined contribution qualified plan like a 402 -LRB- k -RRB- , you
      may want to participate .
    - For a pension plan to be Qualified it must comply with the Internal Revenue
      Code -LRB- IRC . -RRB- Employer sponsored plans that provide for separate employee
      accounts can qualify under section 401 -LRB- k -RRB- of the IRC . Retirement
      plans do not need to be qualified but to obtain a reduction in current income
      tax , they must be qualified . An Individual Retirement Account is qualified
      under the IRC .
    - A retirement plan can be a deductible qualified or nondeductible non-qualified
      plan , generally consisting of annuities and life insurance . The retirement
      plan should have a future estimated year for the beginning of retirement as
      well as a life expectancy year for death . The retirement plan should reflect
      the personal financial profile of the plan participant which includes risk tolerance
      , product suitability and the established timeline as cited above . Product
      diversity should be a consideration when assigning the allocation of the plans
      product holdings .
    - What does a qualified retirement plan mean ? It means a retirement plan that
      offers some sort of tax benefit to the participant in their savings towards
      retirement in a particular plan . A qualified plan provides benefits that will
      boost the outcome possibilities in most cases . The plans also come with limits
      and conditions that must be met .
    - A private health insurance exchange is a private sector counterpart to the Federal
      Government run or state run health insurance exchanges created as a centerpiece
      of ObamaCare . A private health insurance exchange or marketplace as is now
      the preferred term , is generally going to be an employer based program that
      offers multiple health insurance plan options to its employees . There are variations
      on the private health insurance marketplace theme . Some are built around the
      offering of individual health insurance plans from one or a number of different
      health insurance carriers . Others are built around one group insurance carrier
      that offers a variety of different plan designs at varying price points for
      employees to choose from . Still some others are large enough that more than
      one group health insurance carrier is electing to participate and offer a selection
      of health insurance plans , so in this last example you could have plans from
      Humana , United Healthcare and CIGNA all being offered alongside each other
      thus giving employees an even broader selection of plan designs and perhaps
      provider networks to choose from . In some cases there can be integration between
      a private exchanges and the government based exchanges . This is most commonly
      found in private exchanges built around offering individual health insurance
      plans . This can then allow for employees who would qualify for subsidies through
      the government health insurance exchanges to enroll in those plans while employees
      who do not qualify for subsidies can enroll in health insurance plans offered
      outside of the government exchanges . Another advantage that private exchanges
      can have over their government based counterparts is that they can offer a wide
      array of other employee or individual insurance options such as dental , vision
      , life , disability , critical illness , cancer and accident insurance . Some
      private exchanges can even extend the one stop shopping concept to auto , homeowners
      and other property & casualty based insurance products.The government health
      marketplaces are currently limited to health insurance and some dental insurance
      options . If you are interested in learning about whether a private health insurance
      exchange might be the right solution for your employee benefit needs please
      feel free to contact me .
    - A qualified annuity differs from a non-qualified annuity , which is an annuity
      funded with after-tax dollars . While distributions -LRB- contributions to a
      qualified annuity are pre-tax -RRB- from a qualified annuity are taxed as income
      , distributions from a non-qualified annuity are not subject to income tax in
      their entirety . Qualified annuities are often set up by employers on behalf
      of their employees as part of a retirement plan .
    labels:
    - A qualified plan is generally a government approved define benefit or defined
      contribution retirement plan . It is generally has a pretax or tax deductible
      privilege for the plan participant and accumulates tax deferred . Non-qualified
      plans are not tax deductible , but do accumulate tax deferred with annuities
      and/or life insurance .

      , an experienced broker can also assist you .
    - This is a very pertinent question in the era of ObamaCare . As the term `` portability
      '' implies , this is the ability for a person to own and take their health insurance
      coverage with them regardless of their employment circumstances . The concern
      about portability of health insurance coverage flows from the history in our
      nation where for many decades most working Americans received their health insurance
      coverage through their employer . In an era where many people would work for
      the same company for most , if not all , of their working life , there was little
      concern about losing access to health insurance coverage . As our global economy
      and the American workforce have evolved over the last generation and it is now
      common for a person to work for multiple companies over the course of their
      working lives and having your health insurance tied to your place of employment
      has become more problematic for some people and become a social , business and
      political issue . A common example is the person who works for a company that
      provides health insurance benefits to its employees and this person has a pre-existing
      health condition like diabetes or has a covered dependent with a chronic health
      problem requiring expensive ongoing care that is covered by their current employer
      's health plan . One day this employee may be presented with a job opportunity
      with another company that offers them a promotion and an increase in pay that
      would further their career but this prospective new employer does not offer
      health insurance to its employees . Losing their current employer 's health
      coverage might have left this person or their dependents uninsurable or faced
      with such high out-of-pocket expenses for individual health insurance and out-of-pocket
      expenses that these factors would negate the new job opportunity being offered
      this person . Similar examples can be given for the person who wants to leave
      and start their own business , medical cost issues have made it difficult ,
      if not impossible , for some people to pursue such opportunities . This is what
      is referred to as `` Job Lock '' . One of the positive aspects of ObamaCare
      is that with its guaranteed issue and no pre-existing conditions exclusions
      or coverage waiting period requirements , people are guaranteed access to individual
      or small group health insurance . Technically , this does break the chains of
      `` job lock '' for such persons . Please note though , that I stressed the changes
      made by ObamaCare have removed barriers to access to health insurance . Depending
      upon the income level of the person , it -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- may or may not
      remove the cost barriers associated with getting health insurance due to the
      resulting increases in health insurance rates we have seen and are seeing .
      But , in the ideal scenario , these new provisions of the health law provide
      persons with the security of owning their own health insurance coverage that
      is not tied to their place of employment thus eliminating concerns about ``
      job lock '' and freeing them to pursue other professional or personal goals
      that they might not have otherwise been able to address .
    - In an aggregate sense , Yes . The basic costs of health care -LRB- doctor &
      hospital services , prescription drugs , etc. -RRB- and our population 's consumption
      of health care services have been steadily increasing for decades . Health insurance
      costs are merely a reflection of these underlying factors . When one drills
      down to a specific company 's or a specific individual 's history with their
      health insurance premiums then you will find substantial variations in individual
      results . A knowledgeable and experienced health insurance broker/consultant
      can often manage their client 's benefits costs in ways that `` beat the market
      '' just like there always are some financial experts who outperform their peers
      in the stock market . The vast majority of my small business clients for instance
      have premium costs and benefit levels in 2014 that are not radical departures
      from their costs of a few to several years ago or , at the worst , they know
      that they have the best possible base cost level currently available to them
      in their marketplaces . This requires constant oversight of changing marketplace
      conditions , switching insurance carriers to take advantage of whichever carrier
      has the best value proposition at that particular time , and some fine tuning
      of benefit plan designs and funding approaches over a period of years to accomplish
      these results . But , it can be done because I have done it . The implementation
      of the new requirements of ObamaCare have upset the long established rules for
      the health insurance marketplace and are having a profound impact on health
      insurance plan designs and costs . ObamaCare addressed many access issues to
      health insurance coverage -LRB- guaranteed issue of policies , no pre-existing
      conditions , etc. -RRB- but really does nothing to reduce either healthcare
      costs or consumption . In fact , many can argue that ObamaCare is helping to
      increase both costs and consumption which will translate into higher health
      insurance costs . Certainly ObamaCare is the most profound change in our nation
      's health insurance system in most people 's lifetimes and it will make the
      years ahead much more challenging for both individuals and businesses when it
      comes to managing their health insurance & health care costs . The guidance
      of an experienced health insurance expert who is staying on top of the rapid
      changes being prompted by ObamaCare is now more important than ever to both
      the individual and business health insurance consumer . If I can be of assistance
      in guiding you through these uncharted waters please feel free to contact me
      so I can put my 30 years of experience to work for you .
    - 'Under certain conditions , Medicare Part A will cover intermittent or part-time

    - There are numerous factors involved in the rising cost of health insurance and
      one could write a book about them . Some of the most important factors are ;
      1 -RRB- Health care costs continue to rise . Whether it is hospital services
      , physician care , prescription drugs or virtually any health care service you
      can name , their costs continue to rise from one year to the next . Health insurance
      rates are merely a reflection of the underlying costs of the health care services
      their policies cover . 2 -RRB- Obamacare Taxes and Fees - buried in your health
      insurance premiums are taxes and fees that were created by the `` Affordable
      Care Act '' . Some are direct such as a reinsurance fee that was over $ 5 per
      covered person per month in 2014 and is to be used to offset losses that insurance
      companies may incur from enrolling too many unhealthy members now that ObamaCare
      has prohibited underwriting for risk and pre-existing conditions exclusions
      , to the medical device tax that adds to the cost of a wide variety of medical
      devices such as artificial hip joints . These increased costs are , of course
      , passed on to the consumer . 3 -RRB- Changes to how health insurance policies
      can be rated and issued - ObamaCare requires that health insurance policies
      be `` guaranteed issue '' -LRB- a person ca n't be declined for coverage -RRB-
      and that no pre-existing condition exclusions , limitations or waiting periods
      are allowed . This literally means that a person can be terminally ill or about
      to give birth and if they enroll during the annual open enrollment period or
      a special election period they are guaranteed to get coverage . Obviously ,
      taking on a claim that can range from thousands of dollars to a million or more
      when the insurance company in turn may receive only a tiny fraction of that
      amount in premium payments from the sick or injured person creates a shortfall
      that has to be made up through higher premiums for other insured persons . 4
      -RRB- Increasing consumption of health care services . As the American population
      ages -LRB- with the Baby Boom generation moving into its retirement years -RRB-
      they naturally consume more health care services of all types . With the barriers
      to access to health insurance being removed and Medicaid eligibility expansion
      this also increases the consumption of health care services . A basic law of
      economics is that increased demand for something with a limited supply -LRB-
      there are only so many doctors , hospitals , etc. -RRB- will lead to higher
      prices . While this is not a comprehensive list of the factors driving health
      insurance costs higher , these are some of the key ingredients .
    - 'The definition of `` good '''' varies from person to person and business to
      business . However , here are some of the aspects of a health insurance policy
      I advise my clients to be aware of and comfortable with : 1 -RRB- Are the doctors
      , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use in-network providers with the health
      insurance plan you are considering ? 2 -RRB- What would your coverage be -LRB-
      if any -RRB- if you want to use a health care provider who is not an in-network
      provider with the health insurance plan you are considering ? 3 -RRB- What is
      the pharmacy benefit under the health plan you are considering ? And , if you
      have specific prescription drug needs are they covered under the health insurance
      plan ''s prescription formulary and to what extent are they covered -LRB- copays
      , co-insurance , deductible & co-insurance -RRB- ? 4 -RRB- Does the health insurance
      plan allow its members to go directly to specialists such as cardiologists or
      does it require that you are referred to a specialist by your primary care physician
      first ? 5 -RRB- If you travel regularly outside of your home area -LRB- to other
      states or outside the USA -RRB- does the health plan provide for coverage outside
      of your home service area in the event you need non-emergency care ? 6 -RRB-
      Is the health insurance company you are considering a well established national
      or regional health insurance carrier with strong finances or is it one of the
      new , experimental Co-Op health plans recently established under the provisions
      of ObamaCare ? 7 -RRB- Does the overall value proposition of the health insurance
      plan you are considering meet your current and anticipated needs ? In other
      words , does its monthly premium , coverage levels and provider network really
      work for you .'
    - Health insurance paid by an employer for coverage on an employee or the employee
      ' s dependents is deductible as a normal business expense under IRC Section
      162 . Health insurance benefits are not wages and therefore are not subject
      to wage taxes . For this purpose , the term `` employee '' includes an owner/employee
      of a C-corporation but does not include owner employees of other types of businesses
      . Self-employed individuals may deduct 100 % of the cost of health insurance
      as an `` above the line '' expense on the front page of their Form 1040 . The
      deduction is available to all qualifying taxpayers , regardless of whether they
      choose to itemize their other expenses . Direct deductions from gross income
      are allowed only to the extent of the amount of net self-employment income .
      Excess amounts , if any , may be deducted of Schedule A as listed in the ``
      Individuals '' section below . The term `` self-employed person '' for this
      purpose includes non-salaried owners of S-corporations , LLCs , partners and
      sole proprietors underIRC Section 162i . WEBSITELINK Except for salaried owner/employees
      , health insurance paid by a business on behalf of a self-employed person is
      not a deductible business expense . For example , if an S-corporation that pays
      for health insurance for its non-salaried owner/employee , this expense is not
      listed as a business expense on the Form 1120 but rather the deduction flows
      directly through the Form 1120S to the individual owner ' s Form 1040 . Health
      insurance for salaried owner/employees is treated the same as regular employees
      except that an adjustment for self-employment tax is made . Health insurance
      benefits provided by an employer are not taxable income underIRC section104and105
      . This includes amounts paid by the employer to reimburse the employee for the
      cost of health insurance . Of course , the employee may not `` double-dip ''
      by deducting the cost of these tax-free benefits on an individual tax return
      . The cost of health insurance paid by individuals is tax deductible only to
      the extend that the cost of coverage they paid , in combination with some other
      specified expenses , is more than 7.5 % of adjusted gross income . For most
      people , this limitation effectively means that they do not get a tax deduction
      for the cost of health insurance paid . The cost of health insurance paid by
      an employer is a deductible personal expense if the amount is included as wages
      in Box 1 of Form W2 , but this is a relatively rare situation .
    - Health insurance rates increase because the underlying cost of health care services
      increases every year and our population 's average consumption of health care
      services has been increasing for many years . If the cost of gasoline steadily
      rises and at the same time you are driving more miles each year then you understand
      it costs you more to operate your car . Health care services are the gasoline
      and using more health care per person is the increased miles driven part of
      the analogy above . That addresses the basic economic factors that have been
      happening for decades . Now add to those the impacts of the Affordable Care
      Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- and you have a whole new set of cost drivers being
      added to the equation . For example , ObamaCare does add taxes and fees to insurance
      plan costs and medical devices - these costs are passed on to the consumer .
      The law mandates that a wide range of preventive health care services must be
      covered at 100 % , all policies must cover maternity -LRB- many individual policies
      did n't -RRB- , no medical underwriting is allowed , polices must be guaranteed
      to be issued and pre-existing conditions must be covered immediately , and these
      are just some highpoints of the coverage changes now required . While all of
      these requirements may sound good , and they do benefit many people , there
      is no way around the fact that such changes will increase health care consumption
      even further . More demand for a finite resource equals higher costs . An aging
      American population is also a driver of increased health care consumption and
      , with the Baby Boom generation entering their retirement years , will be for
      years to come . This gives you a generaloutline of why your health insurance
      rates have been increasing and will continue to be increasing for the foreseeable
      future . As I described above , our nation has many structural issues that drive
      health insurance rates higher . Despite its name , the Affordable Care Act serves
      mainly to expand access to health insurance and health care but does very little
      to address any of the underlying factors that lead to higher health insurance
      rates .
    - Utilization management guidelines/requirements in health insurance/managed care
      companiesare designed to maximize the effective use of health care resources
      in a cost effective manner . Such guidelines/requirements can apply to the provider
      of health care services and/or to the insured person . Depending upon the insurance
      carrier and the health insurance program you are enrolled in these guidelines/requirements
      may be either active or passive . This means in some cases they are more like
      strong suggestions with little or no negative consequences for non-compliance
      and in other cases the guidelines/requirements must be complied with for the
      services to be covered at the in-network level of benefits or to not be declined
      for payment . Utilization management is a far reaching term that can touch virtually
      every aspect of health care from physician care to prescription utilization
      . The objective is to establish a set of recommended best practices and steps
      in treatment to be followed when dealing with a person 's health problems .
      For example , you might be required to try a long established prescription medication
      that is now a lower cost generic to treat a condition and have to show that
      the desired results were not being obtained before you might be approved for
      a newer , name brand medication that treats the same condition but is much more
      expensive . Having certain procedures performed on an outpatient basis rather
      than requiring a hospitalization is another example . The bottom line is that
      utilization management protocols attempt to get the appropriate level of care
      in the most appropriate and cost effective setting to maximize the value of
      our health care dollars . Sometimes utilization management can be a complicating
      factor in a patient 's and/or doctor 's experience as it may require everyone
      to go through steps A , B , C & D rather than jumping right from step A in treatment
      to step D. But , with insurance costs continuing their relentless rise , the
      consumer should anticipate that utilization management will be much more prominent
      in their health care than ever before .
    - A Medigap policy plugs the gaps that Medicare A & B does n't cover . A person
      can get a Medigap plan part of what Medicare does not may or they can get a
      Medigap plan to cover all of what Medicare does not pay . The cost varies depending
      on which plan a person chooses .
    - 'The answer here is `` maybe '''' . It really depends upon the situation and
      the coverage . In general , if you consider the same house and the same coverage
      , the homeowners coverage will cost you less . let ''s start with some terms
      . In the industry , we usually call landlord insurance either dwelling fire
      , or a dwelling policy . It points to the difference between this and a homeowners
      policy . A homeowners policy has 6 coverages : A. Dwelling - the structure B
      . Other Structures - detached garages , shed ''s , pole barns , etc. . C. Personal
      Property - Your stuff D. Loss of Use - The extra costs you ''ll incur if you
      have to live somewhere while your home is repaired E. Personal Liability - Protects
      you from being sued F. Medical Payments - Pays for injuries that happen on your
      property without having to be sued . A Dwelling Policy , in general does n''t
      have any coverage C , Personal Property . As a landlord , you ''re worried about
      the building and your liability . Your tenant ''s personal property is their
      responsibility to insure . Dwelling policies are more complicated to put together
      than homeowners policies but I ''ll leave that discussion for another time .
      Lets talk about why Dwelling Policy usually costs more than a Homeowners policy
      . With a homeowners policy the insurance company has a greater sense of security
      because they only have one entity to worry about , the homeowners and their
      family . They have a financial interest in keeping their home safe , secure
      , and in good repair . With a rental property , you may have many different
      tenants occupy that home and they have no financial interest in the home itself
      . A tenant is much more likely to let things go that may eventually cause a
      claim . Additionally , with a homeowners policy , the liability is protecting
      the insured from others , with a dwelling policy , you ''re also being protected
      from the people that actually occupy the home . Now , one last thing to mention
      . If you ''re renting your home and it ''s insured on a homeowners policy ,
      change it now . If there ''s a claim on the home and the insurance company finds
      out it ''s being rented , they may refuse to pay your claim . Most homeowners
      policies require the home to be occupied by the owner for coverage to apply
      . Find a good agent that knows how this works and how to put this coverage together
      for your situation . It ''s much better to know what your coverage is and make
      choices rather then to think you have coverage you really do n''t'
    - I 'm unsure exactly of whether you are referring to regular health insurance
      or long-term care insurance . Either way , the cost of coverage under both types
      of insurance will vary from person to person . For health insurance , your age
      , where you live , if you use tobacco products , the carrier you purchase through
      , your plan metal level , and if you qualify for a subsidy to reduce your premium
      will determine how much a good policy is going to cost . Under the Affordable
      Care Act , you have the options for bronze , silver , gold , and platinum level
      plans -LRB- as you go up in metal , the price goes up , but provides better
      benefits -RRB- - some areas also have a catastrophic plan available . In addition
      , your age is a big factor as well . The younger you are , the cheaper your
      premium - the older you are , the higher your premium . Tobacco usage can increase
      your premiums up to 50 % as well . If you 're referring to long-term care coverage
      , a number of factors can affect the cost of the policy such as your gender
      , where you live , the monthly benefit of the policy , the policy 's benefit
      period , any discounts when spouses apply together , etc. . It 's always helpful
      to consult with an experienced insurance broker who can work with you on a personal
      level and help you determine which plan will work best for your specific needs
      . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help
      with your coverage or if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
    - 'Renters Insurance premium depends on the amount of Personal Property coverage
      needed , the amount of Personal Liability coverage needed and your requested
      deductible . It is important to note that your personal property -LRB- contents
      -RRB- coverage and deductible will make up 75 % - 85 % of the premium ; the
      personal liability which in our view is much more valuable only costs a small
      percentage of the premium . We always recommend the maximum available coverage
      for Personal Liability ; depending on your State & location , the maximum may
      cost as little as $ 40 more premiumper year . For a self service quote & issue

    - Full Coverage , or what is known traditionally as Major Medical does not have
      a standard price . The cost depends greatly on a variety of factors . How much
      competition is there in your area ? The more insurance carriers offering coverage
      the better . They will compete to keep costs down to attract membership . How
      big is the population in your area ? The more people the better . Larger populations
      help spread the cost of coverage around to more payers . Then when there is
      a major medical expense there is a larger number of people whose premiums cover
      the cost to the insurer . What state do you live in ? Every state has their
      own mandates on the amount of coverage you might have . Some set a high bar
      which means higher premiums , some stick with the bare minimum demanded by the
      Affordable Care Act which means lower premiums . Also some states allow pricing
      based on age . Younger people are lower risk so their premiums are lower . Some
      mandate a flat rate regardless of age . Exchange versus Commercial Insurance
      ? Commercial insurance -LRB- insurance from your employer -RRB- , or buying
      directly from the insurance company as an individual , might be priced differently
      than buying from an exchange . Depending on your current financial state you
      may qualify for subsidies from the government which would lower the cost of
      the product even though it is the same as the product offered to an employer
      . An exchange navigator would be able to educate you on your specific circumstances
      . Does your employer offer insurance ? Finally , the cost of insurance may be
      dictated by your employer . It depends on the plans they choose to offer as
      well as the amount they may choose to contribute to your purchase of the coverage
      . Some employer pay for the whole thing , some pay half , some may pay a flat
      amount , others offer it but do n't pay anything . I know that 's not a clear
      cut answer but there is no standard price that one can look to . consult your
      employer , a broker , or an exchange navigator for expert advice .
    - There is a huge range in answer to that figure . I depends on your health ,
      first and foremost , as if your health is bad , you may be completely uninsurable
      . If insurable , but in bath health , expect the premium to be much higher than
      if you are in excellent health . Then it goes by age , the younger the less
      expensive . Then what kind of life insurance do you want , permanent or term
      ? Term starts out cheaper but become more expensive as years go by . Finally
      , how much coverage do you want . Certainly $ 3 millions costs much more than
      $ 100 thousand . A capable agent can find the best package to meet your needs
      and abilities . Gary Lane , Agent , New York Life , 949 797 2424 .
    - How much renters insurance premiums depend on how much coverage you actually
      would like to carry on your personal items and how much liability protection
      you would like to obtain . Rates can run as low as 100.00 - 300.00 per year
      on average . I recommend you consult a local independent agent and discuss your
      personal needs .
    - How does health insurance work while on disability ? Since I just ended 12 months
      of disability that included many hospitalizations and treatments , I can tell
      you it works exactly the same as not being disabled . Disability insurance protects
      your income , health insurance protects your health . You can have both going
      on at once . Depending on your employment situation , how your health insurance
      is paid for may make a difference . Maybe your employer continues to pick it
      up , maybe it 's covered under workman 's comp , maybe you pay your own premiums
      . . the main thing is health insurance does n't go away if you 're collecting
      disability insurance .
    - Applying for individual health insurance under the requirements of the Affordable
      Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- is no longer something a person is necessarily
      free to do whenever they choose . In the largest sense , ObamaCare envisions
      the overwhelming number of individual health insurance enrollments to occur
      during the designated annual open enrollment period . This year the open enrollment
      period begins on November 15th , 2014 . So , depending upon your personal circumstances
      you may not even be able to apply for individual health insurance until then
      for coverage effective January 1 , 2015 at the earliest . If you have experienced
      a change of life status event during this year -LRB- e.g. - marriage , divorce
      , loss of employer based coverage , aging off of parent 's plan -RRB- then you
      have 60-days after that event to enroll in individual health insurance coverage
      . It sounds like you would be well served to seek the services of an experienced
      health insurance agent who can help you determine if you might qualify for any
      premium subsidy and whether your health insurance needs would best be met by
      insurance carriers and products either inside the government health insurance
      marketplaces or in the traditional health insurance marketplace . Of course
      , you can go to HealthCare.Gov or check out some other Internet based insurance
      shopping services but I do raise a note of caution about this to the normal
      health insurance consumer . The health care reform law has made understanding
      and comparing health insurance benefits , coverage and provider networks more
      complicated than ever and it is an environment that is still evolving . Getting
      some professional guidance is n't going to cost you anymore and it will provide
      you the assurance that you understand what you are buying and why .
    - From me , of course . If you are like most Americans shopping for health insurance
      is not only about as exciting as watching paint dry but you also find yourself
      in a world you do n't fully understand and where the people seem to speak a
      foreign language . Of course , you can always go online and shop around or ,
      even more fun , go to HealthCare.Gov or your state 's health insurance marketplace
      and shop there . That works for some people but millions of others have learned
      the painful lesson that there are a lot of factors to consider when making a
      purchase as important as health insurance that are very difficult to present
      concisely on a web site . Seek out the services of a qualified life and health
      insurance agent . An independent agent not tied to one specific insurance company
      can shop the entire marketplace for you and can be impartial . An agent with
      additional professional certifications such as Chartered Benefits Consultant
      , Certified Employee Benefits Consultant , Registered Health Underwriter are
      examples of professionals who have taken their education and training beyond
      the simple requirements to get a life and health insurance license . These are
      the characteristics I would recommend you look for in a health insurance agent
      . It does n't cost you anything extra to get these professional 's services
      and they do all the work , can answer your questions , and point out those not
      so obvious issues with provider networks , how your specific medical and/or
      prescription needs are covered by different plans that the average consumer
      often misses or does n't even know to ask about . ObamaCare has not made all
      health insurance policies equal , quite the opposite in fact . Ask your friends
      or co-workers , do an Internet search for health insurance agents , or contact
      me . But you 'll be glad that you got professional guidance on this matter .

    - How do you convert a term policy to whole life ? The best way is to contact
      your agent or if you do n't have one , the company directly and they will assign
      you one . Usually a conversion is nothing more than filling out a single page
      . For a lot of people this is great deal because you no longer have to prove
      your health . So if your health is bad conversion is a great idea .
    - Most term life insurance policies have a convertible provision to permanent
      life insurance or in most cases whole life . This is a great feature for those
      who now have health issues which could cause them not to get a good rate on
      life insurance or even uninsurable all together . I would contact your agent
      . It may make sense to convert all or part of your term to perm . If you are
      still in good health it may make better sense to purchase whole life new and
      replace the old term policy . In most cases convertible term is not the most
      affordable option if health is not an issue . Your term life carrier is assuming
      risk with conversion and that does come at a price . Just be sure to weigh all
      of your options before converting . Good luck !
    - First , `` converting '' a Term policy to Whole Life is n't what it sounds like
      . In most cases there is a time limit by which you must `` convert '' otherwise
      you loose the one benefit of this kind of conversion . Some , -LRB- very few
      -RRB- , providers will actually credit a small amount of what has been paid
      into the Term policy to the new Whole Life policy as long as you 're converting
      with the same provider . When `` converting '' from Term to Whole Life within
      the allotted time frame , the one benefit that is being `` converted '' to the
      new policy is the `` classification '' of the insured . In other words if the
      classification was `` Preferred '' or `` Standard '' , -LRB- whatever the classification
      was -RRB- , with the Term policy , that same classification will be given to
      the new policy without having to have another medical exam or underwriting .
      But the premium for the new policy will be adjusted to the attained age of the
      insured as well as the benefit amount . So how do you go about converting your
      Term to a Whole Life ? Contact your agent or the provider , let them know that
      's what you would like to do . You may be able to or you may not be able to
      . In either case you most likely will loose any money paid into the Term policy
      .
    - That is a great question ! Your policy should have a clause that outlines the
      details of your conversion process , but here 's what you want to do . If you
      purchased the policy through an agent , contact them and let them know what
      you are wanting to do . They will then tell you if your policy is convertible
      , and if so what that conversion will buy for you in a whole life policy . You
      should be aware that your coverage amount will be much lower , and if you want
      to keep the face value that your premiums will become much more expensive .
      Whole life policies are more expensive than term policies are because of their
      cash accumulation features , and the higher risk to the insurer - they do n't
      have to pay out on many term policies , but have to pay out on nearly every
      whole life one . Decide where your budget allows , and what minimum coverage
      you want to keep , and have your agent work with you on getting as close to
      those numbers as possible.I think the conversion is a great idea . If you have
      questions , please do n't hesitate to contact me , okay ? Thanks for asking
      !
    - Such a conversion may be possible so long as your term policy includes such
      a provision . Talk to your Insurance Professional about your contract and whatever
      options and benmefits may be included in it . In many cases , you may find that
      you can convert all or a portion of your term coverage into whole life or other
      form of permanent life insurance . In many cases , this conversion benefit also
      states that you can do so without having to provide any proof of `` insurability
      '' , in other words , without any physical exam or reports by your Doctor being
      needed . Understand that if available , the conversion would take place at your
      current age and the rates applied accordingly so the younger you are when you
      decide to take advantage of this option , the better off financially you will
      be .
    - 'Converting Term to Permanent Insurance requires several things : 1 -RRB- Your
      policy must offer that provision ; 2 -RRB- You must take advantage of that provision
      in the time frame allotted -LRB- each policy has its own deadline to convert
      - such as within x number of years or by a certain age -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- You can
      only convert up to the face amount of your current policy , and there will be
      a minimum face amount , as well ; 4 -RRB- You must convert to the type of policies
      offered for conversion by your insurance company -LRB- some allow you to convert
      to any of their permanent products , while others may offer a very narrow range
      of policy choices to convert to -RRB- ; and 5 -RRB- You may or may not be able
      to keep the remainder of your coverage in Term insurance . If your agent is
      no longer around , contact an agent you trust and give them permission to contact
      your insurer and develop some options for you . By understanding minimum face
      amounts , premium `` banding '''' , and other features offered by that carrier
      , a knowledgeable agent can get you the most bang for your buck . E.g. . If
      you are in good health or still want Term insurance , you may be better off
      getting a new policy . If you are in poor health , you may be able to save money
      by converting to a policy guaranteed not to lapse for a limited number of years
      , rather than paying for a lifetime guarantee . Conversions are easy to execute
      but can be complicated to decide , so having a consumer driven agent in your
      corner can really help .'
    - 'Here is a simple 2-step formula to follow : 1 . Get prequalified for coverage
      with another carrier so you can compare prices . This way you will confirm that
      the premium you will be charged for conversion is the best available . 2 . Depending
      on the results of that analysis , either apply with the new company or simply
      fill out a conversion application with the term carrier . There you go . Either
      way , you will know you have made the right decision :-RRB-'
    - First , `` converting '' a Term policy to Whole Life is n't what it sounds like
      . In most cases there is a time limit by which you must `` convert '' otherwise
      you loose the one benefit of this kind of conversion . Some , -LRB- very few
      -RRB- , providers will actually credit a small amount of what has been paid
      into the Term policy to the new Whole Life policy as long as you 're converting
      with the same provider . When `` converting '' from Term to Whole Life within
      the allotted time frame , the one benefit that is being `` converted '' to the
      new policy is the `` classification '' of the insured . In other words if the
      classification was `` Preferred '' or `` Standard '' , -LRB- whatever the classification
      was -RRB- , with the Term policy , that same classification will be given to
      the new policy without having to have another medical exam or underwriting .
      But the premium for the new policy will be adjusted to the attained age of the
      insured as well as the benefit amount . So how do you go about converting your
      Term to a Whole Life ? Contact your agent or the provider , let them know that
      's what you would like to do . You may be able to or you may not be able to
      . In either case you most likely will loose any money paid into the Term policy
      .
    - 'Yes , Term life insurance can be converted to Whole life or some other form
      of permanent insurance if : 1 -RRB- The policy you got has the option to be
      converted , 2 -RRB- you convert it within the time frame noted , and 3 -RRB-
      you can afford the premium for the converted policy . While a life insurance
      company may carry many types of permanent coverage , they do not always offer
      all of them to be used for conversions . Some companies only allow a term policy
      to be converted to one or two permanent policies , and those may not have all
      the guarantees or features that you might have chosen if the whole array of
      permanent products was available to you . Also , the permanent policy will be
      priced at the rates of that time , and at the age the insured person is at the
      time of conversion You can reduce the face amount to the minimum allowed for
      that permanent policy , but even $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 can be costly at an older
      age and for a permanent product . That being said , being able to convert a
      Term policy to Whole life or Universal life is a great feature , especially
      if someone has had a downturn in health after getting their initial Term insurance
      . There are no health requirements to convert Term life insurance , and the
      health rating for the converted policy will be the same as it was for the original
      Term policy .'
    - If the only conversion option your policy offers is Whole Life , the rate is
      probably going to be quite a bit higher than if you take out a new , no lapse
      , Universal Life policy . However , when you convert Term Life , you are rated
      the same on your Whole Life that you were rated on your Term policy . So if
      your health has declined , you may be getting a good deal by converting . If
      it has not declined , I personally would check out a new policy to see how much
      you can save . As to when to convert , it depends on several factors . 1 . HOW
      MUCH you want to convert . If you want to convert it all , it may be a good
      idea to do it now , while rates are lower . They will go up quite a bit over
      the next 10 years . 2 . YOUR HEALTH . If you have very poor health , you may
      just want to pay those low Term rates another 10 years . If you have excellent
      health , it might be a good time to convert or look at what else you can get
      in a permanent policy . 3 . WILL YOU NEED LIFE INSURANCE after age 60 ? By the
      time you are 60 you should have a good idea of whether you will need that much
      coverage . You have some time to get a feel for how your retirement is going
      to pan out before you make this big decision . You can not reverse it and go
      back to Term , once you have converted your policy . Please feel free to contact
      me to help you ascertain what prices are out there for you , or help you figure
      out what direction to go . Best wishes .
    - The cost of life insurance can range from a few dollars per month to many thousands
      per month . The real question is how much would it cost you to get the proper
      policy for your situation . In order to find that out you need to first determine
      how much death benefit you need . The best way to calculate how much life insurance
      you need is by doing a comprehensive needs analysis . If you are looking for
      a quick rule-of-thumb , we recommend you carry at least ten times your annual
      income in life insurance . The second factor is how long do you think you will
      need the coverage . You might want life insurance to cover your mortgage which
      will be paid off in a certain period of time , or you might want life insurance
      just until your children are grown and self supporting . Maybe you want to have
      life insurance for whenever you die , be it next year or when you 're 90 . The
      third key factor is your budget . You might like the idea of a large permanent
      life insurance policy , but the premium may simply be more than you can reasonably
      afford . So in order to determine how much life insurance costs per month ,
      you need to figure out how much life insurance you need , how long you need
      it and what your budget allows . By going through this process you can determine
      how much the proper life insurance policy for you will cost .
    - Getting life insurance on your children is a way of ensuring that they can have
      life insurance when they are adults . While many health conditions are being
      rated more favorably by life insurance companies due to improvements in medical
      treatments , I also see fewer and fewer choices for young people with serious
      health conditions . Purchasing life insurance on your children while they are
      healthy is a simple and inexpensive way to give them the security of life insurance
      for the rest of their lives . Whether you get them Whole Life , Term insurance
      that they can convert to permanent insurance later on , or just put them on
      a child rider that they can change to 5 times that amount in permanent insurance
      when they become an adult , each option provides this chance to have life insurance
      for life even if a health condition has developed along the way .
    - As stated , voluntary Term is offered on group policies and is voluntary , meaning
      you do not have to take it . Term insurance means that it is only offered for
      a specific period . Never rely on voluntary term as your whole insurance package
      . This only covers you while you are employed . That is why it is called term
      insurance . Some contracts will allow you to convert it to a permanent policy
      if you leave your job but that would be at a much higher rate . Most however
      do not offer that option . Some individual health policies also offer voluntary
      term insurance . This covers you while you have that policy but you lose it
      if you change insurance companies . You are better off in most cases to purchase
      insurance on your own .
    - The BEST life insurance product is the one that meets your needs . Therefore
      , you must ask yourself ; What is the goal ??? Term and Permanent insurance
      are two different products for two completely different needs . Term insurance
      is a product for just that , a fixed term , with either a level premium for
      the selected term or an increase annual payment if you were to choose renewable
      term . Since the contract isfor a fixed period of time , premiums are typically
      a portion of what the same coverage would be with a Permanent product as there
      are no cash accumulation or surrender features , making it affordable for those
      who need it . Regardless , term insurance is great for those with a need for
      coverage in the event of a loss of life , for a fixed term , i.e. the income
      or performance of the insured will be relied on by others . Additionally , term
      insurance is a great way for families with a limited income , to protect and
      provide for the family and young children in the event of the loss of the family
      breadwinner or equally important , the caregiver -LRB- many `` breadwinners
      '' undervalue the benefit provided by the stay-at-home spouse and over look
      childcare costs ! -RRB- which will help with living and education expenses for
      the surviving family . In the future , these young families can always re-analyze
      goals and needs and when their income allows , and convert to a permanent product
      . Term is also very useful for businesses to protect themselves against the
      loss of production and revenue in the event of a death of a key employee . This
      type of insurance planning called Key-man coverage , is cost affordable when
      using term insurance . Lastly , many of the attractive riders that are issued
      with permanent life policies can also be issued with term policies . Permanent
      insurance is a product with virtually infinite uses depending on your needs
      . Permanent life insurance products are just that , permanent for the life of
      the insured , so long as the owner has paid a sufficient amount of premium to
      maintain the coverage . In comparison to term , permanent life insurance is
      more expensive in order to account for the cost of insurance in later years
      of the insureds life . However , there are multiple advantages to buying permanent
      coverage as soon as you can afford it when you are younger . Aside from a lower
      level premium amount to carry the policy to maturity , more time will allow
      for a larger accumulation of cash value in the policy . This cash value , accumulating
      at a tax-deferred rate that beats current treasuries , can also be accessed
      through policy loans and withdrawals in the event of emergency cash needs ,
      can be used as collateral for business or personal loans and can also be used
      to support you during retirement , assuming that the need for coverage has been
      reduced . There are two main forms of permanent coverage , Whole Life products
      and Universal Life products , each with their own attractive features including
      dividends , increasing death benefit , flexible premiums and crediting rates
      indexed to stock market performances . Before making the decision to purchase
      either , be sure to sit down for a -LSB- typically free -RSB- consultation with
      a licensed life insurance agent who will help you identify both your short term
      and longer term needs and goals . Together , you should be able to put together
      an effective plan that will blend affordability and proper protection to meet
      your life insurance needs .
    - Not all term life insurance policies are created equal . You must confirm that
      the policy allows for conversions to a permanent policy and the length of time
      the policy allows you to convert . Keep in mind that the life insurance company
      may limit their permanent life insurance policies to designated contracts and
      not their full inventory . Unfortunately many permanent products are not competitive
      , so its very important in your purchasing decision for term life insurance
      to also consider the companys permanent product inventory in the event that
      you need to convert .
    - If you are asking the question how long the proceeds will last to the survivors
      at your death , that answer is dependent on what you want the life insurance
      to pay for or fund at your death and the amount of money a surviving spouse
      or child will need each month after you have passed on . If you are asking the
      question regarding life insurance products , whole life is designed to last
      to age 99 . Term life insurance will expire at the end of the policy term if
      not renewed or converted . Keith Prim - Dallas , TX 214-435-0791
    - It depends on the type of life insurance . Term is pure coverage meaning you
      are covered for the length of time the term is meant to cover . If you get a
      10 year term , you are covered up to the 10 years . Most terms are convertible
      to a permanent policy , but most have a conversion period so be sure to read
      the life contract . Other forms of life such as whole and universal life are
      meant to cover the insured until death , but you have to make sure that you
      have paid enough in for the policy not to lapse . The outline of the plan should
      be in your life contract .
    - You may never have a reason to cancel Term Life Insurance . If you are paying
      a reasonable rate but no longer need the coverage , you might consider changing
      your beneficiary to a charity or grandchild . You can even convert your Term
      insurance to Permanent so that the policy never ends . If you got your policy
      at a young age and in good health , you will never get rates like that again
      , so think twice before you cancel it . You may even find that a relative is
      willing to help pay your premiums for you to keep or convert it , so that they
      do not have to worry about how to pay for your final expenses when you pass
      .
    - 'What is the best Whole Life Policy ? While there is no direct answer to this
      , the best answer is whatever policy will best protect your family . There are
      different types of whole life policies . The most common is ordinary whole life
      , also called `` straight Life '''' or `` Permanent '''' -LRB- cash value -RRB-
      Insurance . You pay a level premium for the rest of your life , as long as you
      are making your monthly premiums . The premium never increases and your policy
      accumulates cash value . How much life insurance -LRB- death benefit -RRB- will
      you need ? That determines on a number of factors such as : Do you have any
      children/grandchildren you want to leave money to ? How much of your income
      does your spouse depend on ? Who depends on you financially ? How much debt
      do you owe ? Do you want to leave money to your favorite charity ? You want
      to make sure you buy enough life insurance to cover your financial obligations
      if an unexpected or untimely death occurs . It is also important your premium
      fit ''s within your budget . Because if you ca n''t afford it , it is n''t any
      good for you or your family . An insurance agent is the best person to get with
      to compare the different types of life insurance and find a policy that best
      suits your situation . I work with many top insurance carriers with the most
      competitive rates . I ''ll do the shopping for you ! Thank you & Be Well , Mendy

    - A conversion credit is a discount on premiums due on a permanent life insurance
      policy upon conversion . For example , if you have a term life insurance policy
      that has a $ 500 annual premium and to convert the policy to a permanent policy
      that has a premium if $ 5,000 per year , you will only owe the insurance company
      $ 4,500 in the first year you convert providing the insurance company offers
      a credit equal to the annual term premium . Credits are typically offered only
      in the year of conversion and generally are the amount of one year 's worth
      of term insurance premium .
    labels:
    - How do you convert a term policy to whole life ? The best way is to contact
      your agent or if you do n't have one , the company directly and they will assign
      you one . Usually a conversion is nothing more than filling out a single page
      . For a lot of people this is great deal because you no longer have to prove
      your health . So if your health is bad conversion is a great idea .
    - Most term life insurance policies have a convertible provision to permanent
      life insurance or in most cases whole life . This is a great feature for those
      who now have health issues which could cause them not to get a good rate on
      life insurance or even uninsurable all together . I would contact your agent
      . It may make sense to convert all or part of your term to perm . If you are
      still in good health it may make better sense to purchase whole life new and
      replace the old term policy . In most cases convertible term is not the most
      affordable option if health is not an issue . Your term life carrier is assuming
      risk with conversion and that does come at a price . Just be sure to weigh all
      of your options before converting . Good luck !
    - First , `` converting '' a Term policy to Whole Life is n't what it sounds like
      . In most cases there is a time limit by which you must `` convert '' otherwise
      you loose the one benefit of this kind of conversion . Some , -LRB- very few
      -RRB- , providers will actually credit a small amount of what has been paid
      into the Term policy to the new Whole Life policy as long as you 're converting
      with the same provider . When `` converting '' from Term to Whole Life within
      the allotted time frame , the one benefit that is being `` converted '' to the
      new policy is the `` classification '' of the insured . In other words if the
      classification was `` Preferred '' or `` Standard '' , -LRB- whatever the classification
      was -RRB- , with the Term policy , that same classification will be given to
      the new policy without having to have another medical exam or underwriting .
      But the premium for the new policy will be adjusted to the attained age of the
      insured as well as the benefit amount . So how do you go about converting your
      Term to a Whole Life ? Contact your agent or the provider , let them know that
      's what you would like to do . You may be able to or you may not be able to
      . In either case you most likely will loose any money paid into the Term policy
      .
    - That is a great question ! Your policy should have a clause that outlines the
      details of your conversion process , but here 's what you want to do . If you
      purchased the policy through an agent , contact them and let them know what
      you are wanting to do . They will then tell you if your policy is convertible
      , and if so what that conversion will buy for you in a whole life policy . You
      should be aware that your coverage amount will be much lower , and if you want
      to keep the face value that your premiums will become much more expensive .
      Whole life policies are more expensive than term policies are because of their
      cash accumulation features , and the higher risk to the insurer - they do n't
      have to pay out on many term policies , but have to pay out on nearly every
      whole life one . Decide where your budget allows , and what minimum coverage
      you want to keep , and have your agent work with you on getting as close to
      those numbers as possible.I think the conversion is a great idea . If you have
      questions , please do n't hesitate to contact me , okay ? Thanks for asking
      !
    - Such a conversion may be possible so long as your term policy includes such
      a provision . Talk to your Insurance Professional about your contract and whatever
      options and benmefits may be included in it . In many cases , you may find that
      you can convert all or a portion of your term coverage into whole life or other
      form of permanent life insurance . In many cases , this conversion benefit also
      states that you can do so without having to provide any proof of `` insurability
      '' , in other words , without any physical exam or reports by your Doctor being
      needed . Understand that if available , the conversion would take place at your
      current age and the rates applied accordingly so the younger you are when you
      decide to take advantage of this option , the better off financially you will
      be .
    - 'Converting Term to Permanent Insurance requires several things : 1 -RRB- Your
      policy must offer that provision ; 2 -RRB- You must take advantage of that provision
      in the time frame allotted -LRB- each policy has its own deadline to convert
      - such as within x number of years or by a certain age -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- You can
      only convert up to the face amount of your current policy , and there will be
      a minimum face amount , as well ; 4 -RRB- You must convert to the type of policies
      offered for conversion by your insurance company -LRB- some allow you to convert
      to any of their permanent products , while others may offer a very narrow range
      of policy choices to convert to -RRB- ; and 5 -RRB- You may or may not be able
      to keep the remainder of your coverage in Term insurance . If your agent is
      no longer around , contact an agent you trust and give them permission to contact
      your insurer and develop some options for you . By understanding minimum face
      amounts , premium `` banding '''' , and other features offered by that carrier
      , a knowledgeable agent can get you the most bang for your buck . E.g. . If
      you are in good health or still want Term insurance , you may be better off
      getting a new policy . If you are in poor health , you may be able to save money
      by converting to a policy guaranteed not to lapse for a limited number of years
      , rather than paying for a lifetime guarantee . Conversions are easy to execute
      but can be complicated to decide , so having a consumer driven agent in your
      corner can really help .'
    - 'Here is a simple 2-step formula to follow : 1 . Get prequalified for coverage
      with another carrier so you can compare prices . This way you will confirm that
      the premium you will be charged for conversion is the best available . 2 . Depending
      on the results of that analysis , either apply with the new company or simply
      fill out a conversion application with the term carrier . There you go . Either
      way , you will know you have made the right decision :-RRB-'

    - Knowing the disadvantages of all financial assets is a good idea , so good for
      you to check ! All financial assets have their issues . The key to financial
      success is to determine which ones fit your financial situation the best and
      how to assemble an overall mix of assets that serves you best . Annuities often
      have a place in a portfolio even with their limitations . You would think your
      question would be easy to answer . The true , but maybe not too satisfying answer
      is , it depends on how it is used . Annuities are a tool and when used well
      they can yield excellent results . If used poorly they can be hazardous to your
      financial health . This is a deep topic so I will just list a few things to
      look out for to determine if an annuity is appropriate for you . I would advise
      you to ask your friends for a referral to a reputable insurance professional
      . And I would look to your CPA or tax advisor to advise you on the tax implications
      of owning an annuity . This is best done in a joint meeting of both the insurance
      professional and the tax advisor . Are you under 59 and 1/2 and subject to the
      IRS 10 % early withdrawal penalty How liquid is the annuity ? How long do the
      early withdrawal penalties work and how much will they let you take out annually
      without penalty ? Can you afford to defer your gains and let them grow past
      the penalty periods ? Is there a market value adjustment cost in addition to
      the early withdrawal penalty ? How is the interest rate calculated ? How long
      are current rates locked in ? Will the credited interest rate go up with rising
      interest rates ? How financially strong is the insurance company you are looking
      at ? Are you confident they will be able to deliver on their contractual promises
      ? What are their independent ratings ? Annuities require ongoing attention .
      Are you willing to meet with your advisors periodically to manage them ? These
      and many other factors should be considered in determining if an annuity is
      appropriate for you . Competent professionals use annuities to provide safe
      income , growth and tax benefits . They are useful in many situations . Be mindful
      that they are only one of many tools a financial professional may use in helping
      their clients ' meet their financial goals .
    - A variable annuity has features that make it an attractive purchase . A variable
      annuity is often seen as a hedge against the ravages of inflation . The time
      to buy a variable annuity is when you want to establish a long term savings
      program . Normally the objective of the program would be to accumulate money
      for retirement . You would consider a variable annuity if you were dissatisfied
      with the return offered on other annuities . The final consideration is to evaluate
      your risk tolerance to determine if a variable annuity is the correct contract
      for you . In order to purchase a variable annuity you must deal with a registered
      representative who holds a variable annuity license in your state . This agent
      receives additional supervision for your safety . This agent will provide you
      with a prospectus for any fund available in the variable annuity The primary
      feature or a variable annuity is that the contract is an annuity . An annuity
      can provide an income that you can not outlive . This feature can be different
      in various variable annuities but the fact that a lifetime income is available
      is extremely important . Another feature that would make a variable annuity
      attractive is that there isnt any taxation on gain during the accumulation period
      of the annuity . The gain is reinvested inside the annuity and this compounding
      effect is very important . A variable annuity unlike other annuities is not
      based upon interest , rather it is based upon the performance of underlying
      investment accounts which you may tailor to suit your specific needs and interests
      . You are normally granted the right to transfer between investment options
      without triggering income taxes . Many of these transfers also avoid any fees
      . There are risks associated with investing in a variable annuity , including
      loss of principal . A variable annuity is flexible . It can be changed throughout
      the accumulation period to meet your specific requirements . You risk tolerance
      can change over time . The variable annuity will allow you to change the mix
      of investments held by the variable annuity . If you become apprehensive about
      the market , there is almost always a fixed account to provide steady interest
      without fear of loss . There are fees associated with a variable annuity that
      are not always found in other annuities . These fees reflect the fact that the
      value of the annuity is invested , rather than merely earning interest . There
      are opportunities in most variable annuities to shift from fund to fund and
      to shift from variable funds to fixed funds . Normally there arent any fees
      for this service . Like most annuities surrender fees may be applicable . This
      is because of the long term nature of the contract and can be understood when
      compared to the early withdrawal penalties that are a part of certificates of
      deposit . These surrender fees are often waived in the event of disability .
      Like other annuities the variable annuity allows you to select a beneficiary
      . Many variable annuities provide for a guaranteed minimum death benefit that
      provides some safeguards for your family should you retire before you retire
      . The death benefit from the annuity would pass by contract to the beneficiary
      in the event of death avoiding probate expense and delay . Many variable annuities
      will return the amount of deposits as a death benefit should the value of the
      annuity be less .
    - A `` single-premium immediate annuity -LRB- SPIA -RRB- '' is an annuity . That
      is to say , an annuity is defined as an income stream that continues until the
      annuitant dies when a person pays a lump sum of money -LRB- single premium -RRB-
      to an insurance company in exchange for that income stream -LRB- annuity -RRB-
      . So , the term `` single-premium immediate annuity '' is a bit redundant .
      Think of it as taking retirement money from a privately funded pension , except
      that , in this case , you are funding it with a one-time , lump-sum of money.The
      important thing to remember is that once you pay the single premium , that money
      is essentially `` gone '' . You have just `` purchased '' an income that you
      can not outlive.There are all sorts of ways to design the annuity -LRB- stream
      of income -RRB- . You can get a monthly check , quarterly check , annual check
      - just about any payment schedule you can think of . You can also have the annuity
      pay out completely should you die before the original single premium you gave
      to the insurance company gets paid out . Should you choose that option , you
      will need to name a `` beneficiary '' to receive the remainder of the payout.Annuities
      , in general , are complex insurance contracts and space is not provided here
      to go into all the details . But , be absolutely certain that an annuity is
      right for you before you fork over the money because once it is committed to
      the contract , you either ca n't get a refund or there are stiff surrender penalties
      associated with backing out of the deal . Work only with an experienced insurance
      professional that has a solid working knowledge of what annuities are , how
      they work , and whether or not it is in your best interest to own one . More
      advanced knowledge about annuities can be obtained by consumer-friendly websites
      online .
    - 'Are we talking about fixed or variable ? I ''ll assume fixed , so here goes
      ... Annuities , for a 5 year old : Do you know how a CD works ? An annuity is
      the same thing , just with a longer time until you get your money back . CD
      ''s are issued by banks , Annuities are issued by insurance companies . Interest
      from CD ''s are taxed each year while interest from annuities are not taxed
      until you take the money . Does this sound like a retirement account ? Yup ,
      the IRS thinks so too . If you take money out before they want you to , you
      ''re penalized 10 % -LRB- stupid government -RRB- . The longer the term , the
      higher the interest you should expect . CD for 12 months = low interest Annuity
      for 10 years = slightly more interest . Were you referring to variable annuities
      ? Think mutual fund account with higher fees -LRB- generally -RRB- . Now , riders
      ... no 5 year old would ever understand these ... except income riders . Here
      ''s the deal : You get X percent of the balance of the account , paid to you

      I still get paid when there ''s no money left ? Yup ! That , my 5 year old friend
      , is an annuity -LRB- with an in come rider -RRB- . There ''s a lot more to
      it than that . I could write a book on annuities -LRB- and many people have
      -RRB- . Make sure you work with a competent advisor who can speak your language
      . If they keep babbling about terms you do n''t understand , move on and find

    - The most important concept to understand when it comes to retirement planning
      is that it is a process of shifting consumption . The decision that must be
      made is how much am I going to consume today and how much do I need tomorrow
      . In todays low interest environment this question is easier to understand .
      In order to have $ 100 a month in retirement , I have to defer consumption of
      a certain amount today , depending upon my age and years to retirement . Once
      it is clear in our minds that retirement planning isnt about beating the stock
      market , winning a jackpot , or winning a national lottery , we can address
      the issue of how to shift those funds that represent our deferred consumption
      . The best place to start is with an advisor who will listen to you and communicate
      clearly with you . That advisor will be careful to measure your risk tolerance
      . The advisor doesnt want you staying awake at night worrying about losing money
      in your retirement plan , which is what happened to many in 2008 . The advisor
      will ask a battery of questions that measure your expectations and compares
      that with your willingness to experience loss . Eventually a picture will emerge
      that will give the advisor a snapshot of your current thinking about investing
      . The good adviser will continue reviewing your risk tolerance throughout the
      period of time that investment advice is being given . The advisor will take
      that information and compile recommendations of funds that would be suitable
      to help you meet your objectives and yet are sufficiently diversified to offer
      a degree of protection for the assets that you will invest . The adviser will
      offer you choices . He may suggest that these assets be held in a variable annuity
      . The annuity has certain features that might be important to you . The variable
      annuity will frequently feature both fixed and variable options . The variable
      annuity will usually allow you to shift assets as your risk tolerance changes
      . For example , at age 60 after several years of having a variable annuity ,
      you might experience a windfall , perhaps a legacy . You might want to become
      more aggressive with your variable annuity . You will be able to shift funds
      to accomplish this change easily . If later reverses make you more tentative
      , you can return your funds into fixed or very conservative options . This ability
      to shift is an important feature of the variable annuity . Ultimately the results
      of the annuity will be a function of the options which you select . While that
      might seem daunting , in fact , if you selected funds in your comfort zone you
      will most likely be pleased with the results . The main point is the process
      of shifting those dollars from current consumption to future consumption . When
      you start spending them you will not remember how much of a return you made
      in a given year . The variable annuity also has the benefit of being an annuity
      . That means that you can select to receive your money in retirement as a life-long
      stream of income . The return on such an annuity can be remarkably high . The
      company will probably offer alternative distribution plans to meet your specific
      needs . There will probably be a survivor option so that your spouse could receive
      the balance of payments if you dont reach a specified age or havent exhausted
      the initial fund . Some companies that issue variable annuities will allow you
      to continue to manage your money in the annuitization process . Then the results
      wont be guaranteed and can rise and fall with the values of the underlying securities
      .
    - There are two basic classifications of annuities , immediate and deferred .
      The immediate annuity provides income payments over the lifetime of the annuitant
      starting within one year of the deposit . The deferred annuity doesnt start
      payments until a later date . Deferred annuities may increase in value over
      time . That increase is not subject to income tax as it occurs . This deferral
      of taxation is a major attraction of annuities . A deferred annuity can be either
      a single premium annuity or a flexible annuity . As a single premium annuity
      it is often used to augment retirement income at a later date , when other streams
      of income may have ceased . It is often used to anticipate increases in inflation
      , providing a much needed boost in income . As a flexible deferred annuity the
      contract allows the owner to make deposits on either a scheduled or unscheduled
      basis into the policy . As mentioned previously earnings on the contract are
      not taxed in the years that the money is accumulating . A deferred annuity can
      be classified into three major groups . The first would be the fixed annuity
      , the second would be the variable annuity and the third would be the indexed
      annuity . The fixed annuity is issued by an insurance company . The owner makes
      at least one deposit and everything that takes place later is the responsibility
      of the insurance company . The company guarantees the growth and guarantees
      the future payments . There isnt any market risk in this policy . A variable
      annuity , while structured similarly by the insurance company that issues it
      , allows that the owner can select the funds that will accumulate to provide
      future benefits . In some cases it may extend the privilege of selecting underlying
      funds into the annuitization phase which will result in uneven results but has
      the potential of exceptional growth . An index annuity lies somewhere in between
      . The index annuity is designed by the insurance company but rather than paying
      a guaranteed rate of interest , bases interest payments on the performance of
      one of the leading market indicators . Commonly these policies are linked to
      the Dow Jones Average or the Standard and Poors index . The annuity has restrictions
      on the amount of interest credited . The interest rate can either be capped
      at a preset percentage or the policy can be written so that only a percentage
      of the rate is applied to the money in the annuity . The trade-off comes when
      the company guarantees a minimum rate of interest . That minimum rate is often
      0 % . What this means is that the annuity can participate somewhat in the increases
      experienced in the stock market without the risk of losing anything . This is
      quite attractive and currently very popular . An aspect of all annuities that
      is often overlooked is that they are not subject to probate . That means that
      as a contract the value of the annuity passes to a designated beneficiary without
      the expensive and time consuming process known as probate . Taxation of annuities
      is another subject but it is important to know where the annuity is going to
      be held to determine its taxation .
    - 'In Canada annuities there are two main types of annuities : accumulation annuities
      and payout annuities . If they are issued by an insurance company they can/do
      include maturity & death benefit guarantees , potential creditor proofing ,
      estate bypass -LRB- privacy and costs -RRB- and more . They are used extensively
      by retirement and estate planners . The topic of annuities with all our industry
      jargon is indeed confusing . Experience has taught me that an understanding
      the basics is the key step . 1 . An accumulation annuity is as the name suggests
      is used to save money , a payout annuity option is included as part of the contract
      . There are two main types of accumulation annuities : Guaranteed Interest Annuity
      -LRB- GIA -RRB- - principle is guaranteed and interest is earned similar to
      a GIC Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIF -RRB- - similar to a mutual fund
      , the principle is at risk , however , with maturity and death benefit guarantees
      , etc. . In Canada , they are also referred to a segregated funds or variable
      annuities . 2 . Payout Annuities , you exchange a sum of money for a flow of
      income . There are many variations with different guarantees but the basic two
      types are : Annuity certain , where in exchange for a lump sum of money you
      receive a guaranteed income for a specified number of years . Life annuity ,
      where in exchange for a lump sum of money you receive a guaranteed income for
      the rest of your life or with a joint life . These are usually purchased with
      a guarantee payment period . The more guarantees , the lower the income . To
      understand an annuity , first understand a mortgage . With a mortgage you receive
      a lump sum of money and pay back principal and interest over a specified term
      until the balance is zero . With a payout annuity certain you are at the opposite
      side of the equation , you exchange a lump sum of money for a guaranteed income
      stream for a specified term . You will find 16 `` I want to ... How do I ''''

    - Annuity companies are required to invest the majority of their portfolios in
      bonds . They do have flexibility to invest in bonds that are rated high or low
      . If a high-grade bond is AAA rated , it will provide a lower return to the
      annuity company . If the annuity company is willing to invest in lower rated
      bonds , the return will be high because of the increased risk . Annuity companies
      also have the flexibility to invest in bonds with different maturity schedules
      . This can have an impact on your annuity renewal rate based on when you purchased
      your annuity and the timing as the bond market moves up and down over time .
      Annuity rates have recently dropped and while nobody has a crystal ball to know
      exactly where rates are going , here 's an approach you can think about and
      see if it addresses your concern . You can use what is called a `` ladder ''
      approach . Take the total amount of what you intend to put into an annuity and
      split it into 3 or 4 pieces . Purchase one annuity now with 1/3 or 1/4 of your
      total amount . Wait one or two years and do the same with the next 1/3 or 1/4
      . Using this strategy can be effective during a time when annuity rates will
      be climbing . Of course , if annuity rates drop , it can work the other way
      . Remember , you always have the option not to purchase a 2nd or 3rd annuity
      if the interest rates are not to your liking . Using the laddered approach does
      leave the question as to what you do with the remaining funds during your ``
      wait and see '' time . That lost time can be a drawback if you 're just going
      to let your money sit in a bank CD which typically earns only a fraction of
      what an annuity can provide . Speak with a qualified retirement income professional
      that can look at your particular situation and help determine the best course
      of action for you .
    - Annuities are used for retirement as a source of regular income . Your annuity
      is tax deferred until you take out payments . The contributions you put into
      an annuity are not taxed , and the earnings are taxed at your tax rate during
      retirement . Therefore , they can be a tax favorable way of earning supplemental
      income during retirement . If you take out an immediate annuity , you contribute
      a lump sum and can begin to take out regular payments nearly immediately . A
      deferred annuity allows you to make payments into it over a number of years
      , then annuitize the annuity to receive regular payments . These payments are
      generally used to add to Social Security benefits and other income during retirement
      . Variable annuities make your annuity more of an investment , with the risks
      that come with variable products . Indexed annuities also allow for more growth
      but protect the original contribution .
    - What happens to an annuity upon death depends on the type of annuity you have
      and the contractual stipulations . If you have an annuity that was set up to
      pay out for the rest of your life , there may be not benefit paid upon your
      death . Some Life Annuities will return what was paid in or pay for a guaranteed
      number of years . A Joint with Last Survivor Annuity will continue payments
      to the spouse . For annuities that will are set up to pay a fixed number of
      years , annuity payments will continue to the beneficiaries just as if they
      did before . If the annuity was not yet annuitized , the proceeds must be received
      by the beneficiaries within 5 years . Contact your agent or the company through
      which your annuity was secured to understand the specifics about your particular
      contract .
    - 'Before defining Variable Annuities , it is important to have an understanding
      about annuities in general . Immediate guaranteed annuity - in exchange for
      a lump sum the insurance company will pay a guaranteed amount for the rest of
      your life , -LRB- with or without a minimum payout guaranteed -RRB- or for a
      specified term or duration . Easy way to understand it is like a mortgage in
      reverse - you give lump sum and get income in return . Immediate variable annuity
      - in exchange for a lump sum you receive an income as above , all or part of
      the income amount depends on the performance of a pool of funds or an index
      chosen by you . Deferred annuity - you deposit fund with an insurance company
      and the funds are invested and you have guaranteed annuity amount or an option
      to receive at maturity -LRB- depending on what you had chosen -RRB- . Variable
      deferred annuity - In Canada , these are typically called segregated funds and
      are similar to mutual funds , but since they are issued by insurance companies
      , they have guarantees at maturity and death.The amount of the investment will
      vary depending on the performance of the funds chosen and can be converted into
      a immediate annuity at maturity . This is a very simple overview of a potentially
      complex subject and you should not take any action before discussing with a
      licensed professional . If you have further questions , or feel that I could

    - Most carriers will only issue a policy for a face amount equal to or less than
      the amount of coverage you have on your spouse . So you 've got to think about
      how much coverage your spouse has , what debts you need/want paid off , do you
      need it for income replacement , . etc. . Many people think that if their spouse
      does not produce an income , then they do not need coverage . This is the wrong
      way to look at it . Just because a spouse may be a stay-at-home mom or dad ,
      does n't mean they do n't need coverage . In many homes , a stay-at-home spouse
      often maintains the house , the yard , buys the groceries , cooks , etc. . If
      the spouse passed away , would you do these tasks ? Or would you pay to have
      someone else do them ? Are you going to do them yourself ? All of these factor
      into the decisions . In short , while a stay-at-home spouse may not generate
      income , he/she may greatly reduce personal expenses . How much does that total
      up to over a given number of years ? It 's helpful to consult with an experienced
      broker who can help you determine how much coverage is suitable to your needs
      and budget . Please feel free to contact me for help or if you have any other
      questions . Thanks very much .
    - Is long term care insurance really necessary ? The answer depends on you and
      what you want to happen to you in a care situation . If you want a say in where
      you go , how you are treated and what you get to keep asset wise , Long Term
      Care makes great sense . You can certainly do without it , but understand you
      give up where you go , how you 're treated and very little if any choice in
      assets you get to keep . All a long term care policy does is give you control
      over how you 're treated when you need a care situation . So no , it is not
      necessary if that does n't matter to you . If it does , then it makes great
      sense . Long term care is an either you get it or you do n't product . Most
      purchasers of long term care WANT the product , very few have to be talked into
      making a purchase . It is one the few products in insurance where you spend
      a lot of time plugging together options for people as they 've already decided
      to purchase , so the question becomes what do they want it to do ?
    - 'Video Transcript : Today ''s question is : What does term life insurance cover
      ? Remember first of all , if we ''re using term , it only covers that period
      in time . If you buy a 20-year term , as an example , it ''s only going to cover
      you for 20 years . If you buy $ 1/2 million dollars of death benefit , you ''ll
      have it for as long as you pay your premiums on time ; you ''ll have that coverage
      . What is it good for ? How does it cover ? It ''s going to cover anything that
      you think that you need . Let ''s say , at $ 1/2 million , you had a mortgage
      at $ 250,000 , you had credit card debt , you had car debt , you had educational
      debt . You want to cover that so that your spouse or your beneficiaries will
      not be actually saddled with your debt if something happened to you . When I
      ''m looking at , ` What does term life insurance ? '' it ''s the time zone ,
      how long do I have , what obligations would I have , and how can I relieve my
      beneficiaries from any of those obligations if something happens to me ?'
    - This is an outstanding question ! It goes to the heart of how best to protect
      your family , and sort through all of the choices out there . It can be scary
      trying to figure out who has the ` best deal ' and since most people do n't
      understand a lot about insurance , how not to get taken . I think it is fair
      to say also that people do n't have a high opinion of insurance to begin with
      , so agents are n't seemingly much better . So why not just choose a policy
      from an on-line company or name brand company ? Here 's what I 'd say to you
      . I have always done business as much by my feel for the person as by their
      product . If my server does n't care about me or my meal , I do n't go back
      to the restaurant , or I only order carryout from them . If a bagger at the
      grocery store just throws my groceries haphazardly into the bags , I 'll look
      for a different line every time . I want to know that the person I 'm dealing
      with cares about me , and my business . I also want to know that I have some
      flexibility - if they 're the only bagger or server , I wo n't go back to those
      places . An independent agent can offer more options than a name brand office
      agent would . The name brand can only offer that companies policies , and prices
      . If their policy is the best one , and I feel the agent truly cares about me
      and my needs , I 'll buy from them . Chances are though , I 've met with at
      least one other independent agent -LRB- one not tied to a single brand name
      - I myself work with several -RRB- to shop prices and coverage before deciding
      . Again , how they presented themselves to me as they worked for my business
      was as much a consideration for me as the policy details . If I did n't feel
      like they cared about anything but the sale , I 'd leave , and thank them for
      their time . When the time comes that I need help -LRB- and it inevitably does
      -RRB- I want someone who cares and jumps to help , not someone who has to hunt
      to figure out who I am . i guess for me , I want a relationship with my business
      people , -LRB- and my clients -RRB- not just a transaction . I hope that helps
      you , and I thank you for asking !
    - 'The challenge to answering the question `` Will annuities increase ? '''' is
      that the answer depends on the context of the question . I will provide an answer
      for different situations and if you would like further clarification you can
      contact me . In Canada , there are basically two type of annuities , immediate
      and deferred . Immediate annuities provide an income in exchange for a lump
      sum . With a deferred annuity , the income is in the future , Deferred annuities
      are often used as an accumulation or investment vehicle . When the investment
      options are guaranteed , it is similar to a guaranteed investment certificate
      , GIC , and could increase through interest growth . In Canada , variable deferred
      annuities are often referred to as segregated funds or seg funds . These are
      similar to mutual funds and their value can increase or decrease depending on
      the fund -LRB- s -RRB- performance . Since they are issued by insurance companies
      , seg funds do offer minimum death and maturity guarantees , typically 75 %
      or 100 % . Some companies also offer resets or the locking in of gains , the
      full details of which are outlined in the plan ''s information folder . One
      major factor in determining the income provided from immediate guaranteed annuities
      is long term interest rates . If rates increase , the amount of income provided
      will also increase . The income from an immediate annuity can also increase
      after issue depending on the terms of the contact . An indexed annuity for example
      can provide for an increase in income each year . Another option would have
      part of the income dependent on the performance of a fund or pool of funds ,
      where the income would increase or decrease depending on the funds '' performance
      . This is a basic overview of a potentially complex subject . Do not take any
      action without consulting a licensed professional . If you have further questions

    - In Canada , immediate and deferred annuities are , with one exception , taxed
      on an accrual basis . The growth or income is taxed as earned , not as received
      . How the income is taxed , depends , if it is interest income or , in the case
      of Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIFs -RRB- , interest , dividends or capital
      gains . Prescribed Annuities enjoy special taxation -LRB- Section 304 of Income
      Tax Act -RRB- . They are taxed on a straight line basis rather than on an accrual
      basis . If you qualify for a prescribed annuity then total amount of `` expected
      '' interest is averaged based on the number of payments . For example invest
      in a prescribed life income annuity and your `` life expectancy '' is 22 years
      . The amount of investment DIVIDED BY `` life expectancy '' EQUALS return of
      your principle and it is not taxed . The annuity payment SUBTRACT the return
      of your principle is taxable . The tax savings can be substantial , which is
      why prescribed annuities are often used to increase after tax income . Especially
      for those who prefer guaranteed interest income . A life insurance policy can
      replace the capital for your estate . Depending on the the individual circumstances
      , increases of after tax income can be 50 % or more . Implementing a strategy
      involving payout annuities is sometimes complicated , it is however , always
      permanent . Search for Retirement / Financial planner in your area . Then look
      for an experienced life insurance broker with a professional designation such
      as a CLU or CFP . If you have further questions , or feel that I could be of
