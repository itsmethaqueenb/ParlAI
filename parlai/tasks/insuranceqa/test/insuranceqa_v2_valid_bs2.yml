      - Sadly no . Medicare does cover a lot of the medical and hospital expenses
        incurred by a hospital stay . But it does not cover the co-pays required by
        Medicare . Medicare will cover 80 % leaving the insured to cover the other
        20 % along with a payment due as a copayment . These payments must be made
        by the insured or by an insurance policy .

      - 'Medigap policies serve as a supplement to Original Medicare . Original medicare
        is an 80/20 plan , where Medicare pays 80 % of the approved charges . The
        beneficiary is typically responsible for the 20 % co-insurance as well as
        co-pays and deductibles that come with Medicare Parts A & B . The Medigap
        policy is designed to pick up the 20 % Medicare does n''t cover in exchange
        for a monthly premium payable to the carrier selected . The most comprehensive
        Medigap policy is Plan F , which covers all of the Part A & B deductible ,
        co-insurance and co-pays , so when the beneficiary goes to receive care their
        is zero out-of-pocket costs . Some plans may also provide benefits like foreign
        travel as well as a gym membership as part of your regular plan . Please note
        : when purchasing a Medigap Policy , you need to add a Stand-Alone Prescription
        Drug Plan to satisfy your requirement as a Medicare Beneficiary to have Part
        D - Prescription Drug Coverage met .'
      - There are 10 standardized Medigap Plans available to Medicare Beneficiaries
        . They include Plan A , B , C , D , F , G , K , L , M , N with Plan F also
        offering a high-deductible plan . The most popular standardized Medigap Plans
        are F , G , and N. Plan F will cover all your Medicare approved charges .
        You do not have to pay any co-pays , co-insurance or deductibles for Medicare
        covered costs . If you choose the high-deductible Plan F , you must pay for
        Medicare covered costs up to the deductible amount of $ 2,140 -LRB- 2014 -RRB-
        before your Medigap Plan F will pay anything . Plan G will cover all your
        Medicare approved charges after you have satisfied the annual Part B deductible
        of $ 147 -LRB- 2014 -RRB- . Once the small deductible is met , Medigap Plan
        G acts like Plan F and covers the co-pays , co-insurance and deductibles that
        Original Medicare does not cover . Plan N covers 100 % of the Part B co-insurance
        , except for a small co-pay for some office visits -LRB- never more than $
        20 per visit -RRB- and up to a co-pay of $ 50 for emergency room visits -LRB-
        waived if admitted as an inpatient -RRB- . You are also responsible for satisfying
        the annual Part B deductible of $ 147 -LRB- 2014 -RRB- and any Medicare Part
        B Excess Charges . If you have further questions regarding your specific situation
        , please feel free to contact me .
      - 'Medigap Plan N is one of the 10 standardized Medicare Supplement plans .
        Medigap Plan N covers 100 % of the following : Medicare Part A Coinsurance
        and hospital costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are
        used up . Medicare Part B Coinsurance -LRB- except for a co-pay of up to $
        20 for some office visits and up to $ 50 co-pay for an emergency room visit
        -- waived if admitted -RRB- . Blood -LRB- first 3 pints -RRB- Part A Hospice
        Care Coinsurance or Co-pay Skilled Nursing Facility Care Coinsurance Medicare
        Part A deductible Foreign Travel Emergency -LRB- Up to Plan Limits -RRB- Medigap
        Plan N DOES NOT cover the following : Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147
        in 2014 -RRB- Medicare Part B Excess Charges -LRB- if the amount a provider
        is legally permitted to charge is higher than the Medicare approved amount
        , the difference is the excess charge -RRB- . Medigap Plan N is used by many
        Medicare Beneficiaries , but it does fall short in not covering Excess Charges
        . It is important to be aware of how Excess Charges can be charged to you
        by a provider who does not accept assignment . You may wonder why anyone would
        bother with Plan N if they have to worry about Excess Charges . The premium
        for Plan N is often the reason why people choose it .'
      - Original Medicare Part A & B do not come with Co-Pays . You are , however
        , responsible for deductibles and co-insurance . Co-pays are mostly associated
        with Medicare Advantage Plans and Prescription Drug Plans . The co-pays do
        have a wide range from one Plan to the next , so it is always a good idea
        to review the Outline of Coverage for the Plan you have or may be considering
        . If you have a Medigap Plan -LRB- also known as Medicare Supplement insurance
        -RRB- , there is one standardized plan that does have co-pays . With Plan
        N , the customer is responsible for co-pays for doctor visits . The co-pay
        will not be more than $ 20 for an office visit . Plan N also requires a $
        50 co-pay for an emergency room visit . This co-pay is waived if you are admitted
        into the hospital .
      - If you would like to have peace of mind knowing that the remaining 20 % of
        Medicare approved charges will be covered by insurance -LRB- instead of your
        bank account -RRB- , then Medigap insurance is absolutely worth it . Medicare
        Beneficiaries with Original Medicare Part A and Part B leave themselves vulnerable
        to the ` gaps ' that Medicare does not cover -LRB- co-insurance , co-pays
        and deductibles -RRB- . This can add up quickly . For example , a $ 5,000
        procedure would leave you with a bill for $ 1,000 -LRB- 20 % co-insurance
        -RRB- . A $ 20,000 procedure would bill you for $ 4,000 -LRB- 20 % co-insurance
        -RRB- . You see where this is going ... $ 50,000 operation means you 're stuck
        with a $ 10,000 hospital bill . Not to mention -- if you have a chronic illness
        , twenty-percent co-insurance can put a huge burden on your budget . I have
        spoken to Medicare Beneficiaries who are paying the 20 % co-insurance . Some
        do n't mind because they have n't had any health issues , but others do have
        health issues and did n't realize they could n't get a Medigap Plan once they
        were sick . Meaning , you are not always guaranteed a Medigap Plan whenever
        you want to buy one . If you are not in your initial Open Enrollment Period
        or another Guaranteed Issue Situation , you 'll have to qualify medically
        . If I can assist you with your personal situation , please feel free to contact
        me .
      - 'What is BEST is so subjective . Office Co-pays , Rx Co-pays , Low Deductible
        , High Deductible , & more all play into the flexible definition of BEST ...
        . HOWEVER , I do see a growing trend that can put a more objective -- that
        is the TYPE of network you buy . PPO / HMO / POS / EPO . Do you know what
        these acronyms mean ? Do you understand the impact on WHO YOU CAN SEE when
        you pick a different network . In my area , Nashville TN , the difference
        in networks is HUGE between carriers . The top carrier has 2002 Family doctors
        in a 50 mile radius of down town ... the # 2 carrier for 2016 ... . only 270
        . 86.5 % LESS doctors to go see . Cardiologists : 201 vs 34 ... 83 % LESS
        !!! I will stand on the statement , `` There ARE better plans . The better
        plan gives you greater access to doctors & hospitals in your area & possibly
        nationally . '''''
      - Medigap or Medicare Supplement insurance is private health insurance established
        to help supplement Original Medicare Part A and Part B. Meaning , it will
        help pay some of the health care costs not covered by Original Medicare -LRB-
        co-pays , deductibles , co-insurance -RRB- . When you have a Medigap Policy
        , Medicare will pay it 's share of Medicare approved amounts for your covered
        health care costs . Then your Medigap -LRB- Medicare Supplement insurance
        -RRB- pays its share . There are 10 standardized Medigap Plans -LRB- A , B
        , C , D , F , G , K , L , M , N -RRB- with varying benefits . Plan F is the
        most popular because it covers all Medicare approved charges and you do not
        have to pay any co-pays , deductibles or co-insurance . Plan G acts just like
        Plan F after you 've satisfied the small annual Part B deductible of $ 147
        -LRB- 2014 -RRB- . WEBSITELINK Please feel free to contact me regarding your
        specific situation . In just a matter of minutes , I can provide you with
        Medigap benefit and quote information to help you make an informed decision
        .
      - If you have group coverage you may not need to pick up Medicare part B right
        away depending on the size of your group . Medicare coordinates with your
        health insurance . For smaller groups it will be primary , for larger groups
        it would be secondary . Primary means that Medicare pays first and your health
        insurance would act like a supplement . Secondary means that your insurance
        pays first and Medicare would just help pay any deductibles and copay 's .
        You do not need a Medicare supplement if you have group health insurance in
        most cases . If you have prescriptions covered at work do not pick up a Medicare
        Advantage plan or prescription drug plan without discussing it with your HR
        rep. You could get knocked off your group coverage and not be able to get
        it back .
      - In short , Medigap does not cover non-medically necessary procedures -LRB-
        e.g. cosmetic surgery -RRB- and items such as routine dental work and eye
        exams . Individual dental insurance plans and vision insurance plans will
        cover the latter programs - elective cosmetic surgery is generally going to
        be paid 100 % out-of-pocket no matter what . Medigap plans pay benefits when
        you have a Medicare-approved service claim . Please note , each Medigap plan
        features different benefits so the question can expand from there as not every
        Medigap plan covers every available Medigap benefit . For example , plan F
        covers each Medigap benefit at 100 % from day 1 -LRB- and 80 % for foreign
        travel emergency care , up to plan lifetime limits of $ 50,000 -RRB- . Plan
        N covers each Medigap benefit at 100 % from day 1 except for coverage of the
        Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 and 2015 -RRB- , Part B excess
        charges , and you have to pay a co-pay when you go to the doctor -LRB- up
        to $ 20 co-pay -RRB- or hospital -LRB- up to $ 50 co-pay -RRB- . I hope the
        information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for further help ,
        including quotes and plan comparisons , and if you have any other questions
        . Thanks very much .
      - Unlike Medicare Advantage Plans , Open Enrollment for Medicare Supplements
        vary by State . Generally most States have a six month Open Enrollment Period
        after Turning 65 to enroll in a Medicare Supplement on a Guaranteed Issue
        basis . After your Open Enrollment Period you will be able to change your
        Medicare Supplement at any time subject to the companies underwriting requirements
        , meaning you must qualify health wise . Keep in mind you will also need to
        pick up a Prescription Drug Plan -LRB- Medicare Part D -RRB- . The Initial
        Election Period for Medicare Part D is three months before , the month of
        and three months after you turn 65 .
      - Original Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B does not cover co-pays , deductibles
        or coinsurance . In fact , it covers only about 80 % of your healthcare costs
        . The remaining 20 % is your responsibility and is limitless unless you have
        a Medicare Supplement Plan -LRB- Medigap Plan -RRB- . Depending on which Medicare
        Supplement Plan you have it can pay all or most of those costs . For more
        information about Medicare or to Compare Medicare Supplement Plans instantly

      - Medicare Part B does not cover prescriptions . Medicare Part A & B only covers
        about up to 80 % of the total costs of healthcare related charges . You can
        get a Medicare Supplement Plan to cover the co-insurance , deductibles and
        other expenses that Part A & B does not cover . In addition , you can get
        a Part D prescription drug plan to cover your prescriptions .
      - 'Jeff Foxworthy might say , `` You might need a Medicare supplement insurance
        policy if ... You get shot for looking at another man ''s birddog and you
        ca n''t afford to go to the hospital . After Medicare pays their portion you
        offer to settle your bill by arm wrestling in a winner take all match . Medicare
        only pays 80 % of your hospital bill and the only way you can pay the other
        20 % is to sell your pick up truck with the big tires and gun rack in the
        back window . #GeorgiaMedigapPlanRates #GeorgiaMedicarePlans #GaMedigapQuotes'
      - Kidney dialysis is a Medicare Part B service . If you have End-Stage Renal
        Disease -LRB- also known as ESRD -RRB- , Medicare will -LRB- generally -RRB-
        coverthree dialysis treatments per week . You pay 20 % of the Medicare approved
        amount , and the Part B deductible applies . This is where your Medigap Plan
        will help cover some if not all of the remaining costs . Medigap Plan F will
        pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount and the applicable
        Part B deductible . You pay $ 0 . Medigap Plan G will pay the remaining 20
        % of the Medicare approved amount after you have paid/met the applicable Part
        B deductible . You pay , at most , $ 147 -LRB- Part B deductible in 2014 -RRB-
        . Medigap Plans A , B , D , M will pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare
        approved amount after you have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible .
        However , you are also responsible for Part B Excess Charges , so you may
        end up paying more than the Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- .
        Medigap Plan Cwill pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount
        and the applicable Part B deductible ; however , you pay for any Medicare
        Part B Excess Charges . Medigap Plan Hi-F will pay all Medicare approved amounts
        after you have met/paid the $ 2,140 deductible -LRB- 2014 -RRB- . Medigap
        Plan Nwill pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount after you
        have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible -- except for a copay of up
        to $ 20 for some office visits . You are also responsible for paying Medicare
        Part B Excess Charges . In regards to Excess Charges , this is what you are
        charged above the Medicare approved amount if the doctor , provider , or supplier
        does not accept Assignment . If a provider does not accept Assignment , they
        are telling Medicare that they do not agree to accept the payment amount Medicare
        approves for the service -- this is how you can get billed for Part B Excess
        Charges .
      - Plan F also referred to as the Cadillac plan offers the most complete coverage
        out of the 10 available Medigap plans . Plan F is the most popular Medicare
        Supplement because you have no out-of-pocket cost because it covers all the
        gaps -LRB- deductibles , co-insurance and co-pays -RRB- in your Medicare Part
        A and Part B coverage . Because it offers the most complete coverage Plan
        F is the most expensive Medicare Supplement and usually will experience the
        largest rate increase . Most people on Medicare would be better served by
        having a Plan G or Plan N .
      - Medicare supplements , also known as Medigap policies work in addition to
        your basic Medicare A and B coverage . Anything that is covered by either
        of those can then be applied to the Medigap plan to pick up some or all of
        the remaining costs . Inpatient dialysis is a Medicare A procedure . Outpatient
        or home dialysis options are covered by Part B . This does not include any
        costs for home health aides , lost wages , housing or blood supplies not included
        in the doctors visit . Depending on your Medigap policy , some of these may
        be covered . Your Medigap policy handbook will tell you if your plan covers
        these additional costs .
      - Medicare Part B premiums are based on your income . For most people , your
        Part B premium is $ 104.90 per month for 2013 , but high income earners could
        pay as much as $ 335.70 per month . If you do n't sign up for Part B when
        you are eligible , you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty . Your Part
        B will have a $ 147 annually deductible and a 20 % co-insurance . The important
        item to remember is that 20 % co-insurance has no limit .
      - In Florida , the best Medicare Supplement -LRB- Medigap -RRB- Plan will depend
        on your individual needs . Across the United States , Medigap Plans are standardized
        -LRB- plans have same benefits regardless of insurance carrier -RRB- . Not
        only can you use your plan benefits in Florida but anywhere in the U.S. as
        long as the provider accepts Medicare . Plan F is very popular because it
        covers all Medicare approved charges . But that does not mean it is the best
        plan for everyone . Plan F is the most expensive plan and Florida 's rates
        are among the highest in the country , and even though you can use your Medigap
        Plan outside of the state , you still have to buy the Plan in Florida if it
        's where you reside . There are a couple other popular plans with lower premiums
        if you do n't mind small co-pays , co-insurance or meeting the Part B deductible
        . As a licensed independent agent in Florida , I can share with you the Plans
        that are available in your area . Since Medigap Plans are standardized , once
        you determine which Medicare Supplement insurance benefits you want then the
        next step is finding the premium that meets your budget . Thank you for reading
        my response . Please let me know if I can be of further assistance .
      - If you have Original Medicare Part A and Part B , you are responsible for
        twenty percent of your medical costs , the Part A deductible -LRB- $ 1,216
        in 2014 -RRB- and the Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- . A Medigap
        Plan helps cover the deductibles , co-insurance and co-pays associated with
        Original Medicare . Often , people will wait until a significant health issue
        arises and then start looking into Medigap insurance . Unless you are still
        in your initial enrollment period or another guaranteed issue situation ,
        you will have to pass medical underwriting requirements with the insurance
        company . The insurance companies are not obligated to sell you a policy because
        Medicare Supplement insurance does not fall under the Affordable Care Act
        . An independent agent specializing in Medicare Supplement Specialist can
        help determine if you can apply for a Medigap Plan based on health conditions
        . This is just one benefit of working with an independent agent . We are not
        employees of the insurance companies . We work for you and contract with many
        insurance companies to help meet the needs of every unique situation . Thank
        you for reading my reply . Please let me know if I can be of further assistance
        .

        Long Term Care policies . The agent must have special training as required
        by their state in order to sell Partnership Long Term Care Insurance .
      - 'Maybe one should not get long-term care insurance . Let ''s start there .
        If an individual or a family has a sizeable estate that either is liquid or
        can be liquidated and be made readily available to pay for the cost of long-term
        care , maybe long-term care is n''t needed . If , on the other extreme , you
        have a very small estate comprised of no real estate and very little personal
        property of any worth and will rely almost entirely on Social Security in
        retirement , you ca n''t afford long-term care premiums , now or in the future
        . You will have to have a plan , however , in case you do need long-term care
        . A family discussion around the topic should be scheduled so that those that
        might become either temporary or permanent caregivers are fully apprised of
        the responsibilities and sacrifices that may have to be made . Medicaid qualification
        should be fully investigated and the benefits and limitations understood .
        People buy long-term care for roughly the same reason they buy life insurance
        . One buys life insurance because they care about the financial security of
        those that are left behind . One buys long-term care insurancebecause they
        care about those that might have to take care of them if they ca n''t take
        care of themselves . Long-term care costs are not covered by conventional
        health insurance , Medicare , and most Medicare supplement insurance . They
        can be very expensive , especially ifthe elderly person lives a long-period
        of time in a state of incapacity . Caregivers will be spouses and adult children
        are likely to be caregivers whether one owns long-term care insurance or not
        . Long-term care insurance is for caregivers . It gives them choices about
        the quality of care that can be afforded and whether they can be relieved
        of some of the responsibility for caregiving . Many elderly spouses of those
        that ca n''t take care of themselves become disabled themselves because of
        the emotional and psychological energy expended in caregiving . Adult children
        sometimes get caught in a conflict over eldercare and parenting growing children
        . Long-term care insurance provides income-tax-free money to hire trained
        individuals to care for loved ones . Ultimately , it allows the insured to
        die with dignity and peace . Getting back to the wealthy that do n''t need
        to buy long-term care insurance , guess what ? Many wealthy couples and individuals
        do . They understand leverage : paying smaller dollars now for larger dollars
        later , if needed . They also understand that in many situations , premiums
        for long-term care may be tax-deductible . What about the middle class ? They
        would have to design their coverage to help offset the cost of long-term care
        . No matter how much one spends , no long-term care insurance policy can guarantee
        to cover all possible long-term care expenses . But , the average claim is
        about 24 - 26 months . Buying a long-term care policy with a pool of money
        sufficient to cover at least part of those costs would be prudent . Is buying
        a basic plan for long-term care that would pay only half of one ''s long-term
        care costs be a bad deal ? I do n''t think anyone that ''s paying $ 400/day
        for facility care and being reimbursed for $ 200/day would find that of no
        value .'
      - 'A better question would be `` Who Should n''t Buy Long-term Care Insurance
        '''' ? Thats simpler to answer . The following people should NOT buy long
        term care insurance : 1 . Those that can not afford the premium on even a
        base policy . 2 . Those that have virtually no assets to pass on to the next
        generationand will need every available dollar saved for retirement . 3 .
        Those that will have to work until they die for lack of savings and insufficient
        Social Security payments or private pension . 4 . Those that can not medically
        qualify . 5 . Those that are already unable to perform regular daily activities
        of living without assistance . People in those conditions may qualify for
        the payment of long-term care through Medicaid -LRB- MediCal in California
        -RRB- if they come to a point in their life where they need care and ca n''t
        afford it . If the above conditions describe you in any way , you should be
        sitting down with your adult children or closest relatives and coming up with
        a plan of action should you be unable to take care of yourself . Everyone
        else should consider buying some long-term care insurance through an agent
        or agency that either specializes or has a specialist that is experienced
        in handling long-term care insurance casework . Having some amount of insurance
        is better than having none . When one qualifies to receive payments from the
        insurance company for long-term care , they are usually near the end of their
        life . The average long-term care claim is approximately 2 - 2.5 years . For
        those that need care longer than that , virtually all but the most unusual
        claims are paid out after 5 years . Families with a history of late-life mental
        illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers -RRB- should consider buying a larger
        pool of money than others , if they can afford it . It is in the best interest
        of the adult children to help out with long-term care premium payments if
        the elderly parents can not afford to pay all of the costs . Long-term care
        is an emotional , psychological , sociological , and family problem as much
        as it is financial . For the dignity of those who need care and the people
        or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs to be a plan of action
        determined and long-term care insurance should be a part of that plan if it
        can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term care insurance
        is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during the life
        of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design of
        the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one needs
        long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today
        . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care
        costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there ''s not
        much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary
        by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation
        may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility .'
      - Roughly sixty percent of Americans will require long term care services sometime
        during their lifetime . This is not exclusively a problem for the elderly
        as younger people can require this type of care some times . This level of
        care includes a range of services including skilled and custodial care that
        is provided over a long period of time . These requirements come from chronic
        sickness or injury , cognitive impairment and physical disability . Hospitals
        provide acute care . Medical care given over a long period of time for chronic
        conditions is where the need for long term care arises . Sometimes custodial
        care is required because the patient has lost the ability to do one of the
        recognized activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily
        living . Most of the long term care given in the US is given by family members
        . However , there are many situations where family members can not provide
        necessary care . Professional and non-professionals can provide aid and assistance
        to these people . This long term care can be given in the home of the patient
        or in a variety of institutional settings . Long term care can be given in
        day-care facilities , nursing homes , and assisted living facilities . On
        average men need more than two years of long term care while women need almost
        four years on average ? The leading causes for patients requiring long term
        care are dementia , arthritis , cancer , stroke and nervous conditions . Caring
        for a patient in a home setting can cost up to $ 150,000 per year . The cost
        for a nursing home bed is about $ 75,000 per year -LRB- this varies by location
        . -RRB- There are basically four ways to finance long term care . The family
        can take the expense out of their own pocket , they can look to government
        programs -LRB- if they qualify , -RRB- they can use long term care insurance
        or they can rely upon charity . For a variety of reasons long term care insurance
        has provided a solution for many people . LTC insurance provides predictability
        for an otherwise unpredictable risk . It has become such popular coverage
        and policyholders have been so reluctant to drop their coverage that the benefits
        have started exceeding the premiums . It is quite popular among wealthy policyholders
        . Many companies that offered coverage have withdrawn and others have been
        forced to raise their premiums . This adjustment seems to be complete now
        . There are various forms of LTC coverage . Policies different widely . It
        is rather difficult to compare but is worth the effort . When deciding on
        a policy the first thing to establish is the amount of coverage you want and
        the period of time you want coverage . The second consideration is how soon
        after the start of long term care will you want the policy to start paying
        . This waiting period is computed in several ways so care must be exercised
        to make sure you are making a fair comparison . Not all policies use the same
        events to trigger benefits so care should be taken in this area as well .
        This can be a very technical area so compare your situation with the policy
        requirements . How a policy pays out will vary according to the policy . Some
        policies provide for reimbursement of expenses , others use an indemnity form
        which pays up to a specific limit of expenses incurred on each specific day
        , and some are on a cash model which pays a maximum benefit regardless of
        the actual cost of the care that is being given . Long term care insurance
        is a way to protect assets . The alternatives deplete assets with the government
        programs requiring a person to be in poverty .
      - 'Short answer : About 8 % Long answer : It ''s hard to say exactly how many
        people own some type of policy that covers paying the costs of long term care
        - should one qualify for it - because there are many types of insurance policies
        that are not just `` stand-alone '''' long-term care policies , but plans
        of insurance that include being able to use a percentage of other plan benefits
        for paying long-term care costs :1 . Stand-alone long-term care insurance
        covers only long-term care costs . It has no cash value . When a policy owner
        dies , coverage either lapses or stops paying benefits . It is not transferable
        . It can not be bought or sold on a secondary market . This type of long-term
        care insurance is sometimes referred to as `` traditional '''' long-term care
        insurance , as well . It is the type of coverage that is most often associated
        with the `` percentage of Americans that own their own long-term care insurance
        '''' .2 . Hybrid long-term care contracts consist of having long-term coverage
        and a life insurance policy that guarantees to at least return the full premium
        paid into the policy to the insured ''s designated beneficiary . Usually ,
        these are single-premium contracts , but some have options to also pay over
        a specified period of time , such as 5 - or 10-years .3 . Linked life + long-term
        care policies are basically a traditional permanent life insurance contract
        -LRB- Whole Life or Universal Life , including the Variable or Indexed type
        -RRB- . If a person qualifies for long-term care and they have the long-term
        care rider on their life policy , they may apply to the insurance company
        to advance or accelerate the face value of the policy -LRB- death benefit
        -RRB- to pay for the costs of care . There are various limitations on how
        much can be advanced at a time . If the face value of the life contract is
        completely advanced for long-term care , there is usually a residual death
        benefit of $ 5,000 - $ 10,000.4 . The latest addition to life insurance product
        lines are policies offering `` living benefits '''' , one of which is very
        similar to the linked-life policy . In fact , the only difference is that
        a medical professional has to state in writing that the insured is not likely
        to recover from the condition that qualifies for long-term care benefits .
        -LRB- True long-term care insurance does not require that . -RRB- This type
        of living benefit is most often referred to as `` chronic care '''' or ``
        extended care '''' . Annuities may also have special considerations for paying
        out portions of the account value for long-term care costs.The point is ,
        people who own life insurance or annuity contracts with long-term care accommodations
        are not typically included in with the 8 % that own traditional long-term
        care . So , the real percentage of those that have made some type of insurance
        purchase to offset long-term care costs is greater than 8 % . I doubt , however
        , that the total percentage of Americans that own any of the above-described
        types of policies would exceed 20 % at this time .'
      - Long Term Health Care Insurance is called , simply , Long Term Care Insurance
        . It covers the cost of living in a nursing home , assisted living home ,
        or receiving other types of services when the insured person is unable to
        take care of themselves . Among those who should buy Long Term Care Insurance
        are those who have many assets and feel strongly that they do not want their
        assets to go toward paying long term care expenses . People who want to have
        many choices in how and where they are cared for , should they be unable to
        care for themselves , are also people who would benefit from Long Term Care
        insurance , if they can afford it . Finally , persons whose families want
        the security of knowing that their parents will not rely on them for long
        term care , if needed , are those who should considering buying Long Term
        Care insurance .
      - 70 % of people who are 65 years old will need to use some type of long term
        care in their lifetime . And , as they age the likelihood of needing long
        term care will increase . The cost for this care is very expensive and it
        is not covered by conventional health insurance - commercial carriers or Medicare
        . This is because our health care system is geared to acute care not long
        term care . According to the 2015 Genworth survey the national average cost
        for a semi-private room in a nursing home is about $ 80,000 . More , for a
        private room . Home Health care costs average $ 20/hour . These expense arise
        when most people are living on a fixed income with little room for added expenses
        . Especially , unplanned ones . Baby boomers have not been great at planning
        for retirement . One year of long term care can ruin someone 's retirement
        plans . This is what happens in many cases ; families deplete their assets
        and end up qualifying for Medicaid -LRB- aka Welfare -RRB- to pay for long
        term care expenses . The question people need to ask themselves is when the
        need for long term care arises , will they have the money to pay for this
        care ? This is what long term care insurance can do for them . Insurance is
        the only financial vehicle that promises a specific amount of money at a point
        in time . There is no other . Even though this can be an expensive premium
        , depending on the age at which the policy is purchased , compared to the
        benefits paid , it is worth the outlay for most people . Not only because
        it will help pay the bills . Long term care insurance policies offer additional
        benefits that most people are unaware of . Most importantly , all carriers
        offer optional care management to assist with the difficult decisions about
        care , choosing facilities and offering discounts on major providers of care
        . Many times families need someone to discuss options with who is educated
        about all the options available and is n't emotionally involved with their
        situation . This is where the care manager can be of tremendous help and the
        family does not have to go to the expense of hiring a geriatric care manager
        . The policies will also pay for modifications to be made to the home to keep
        the person at home rather than moving them to a nursing home .
      - Is long term insurance a good buy ? Well it all depends on your needs and
        your assets . The big thing long term care does is provide you a pool of money
        to help you choose what you want to have happen regarding your care . Without
        long term care coverage any situation that comes up where you need care ,
        you 'll be faced with where ever will take you and quite possibly a reduction
        in assets to cover the cost . The idea of long term care being a good buy
        is strictly in the eye of the beholder . For some it does n't matter and for
        others it is just a matter of plugging in the right variables to make the
        plan work best .
      - Not everyone needs long term care insurance . LTCI is not for persons who
        are struggling to meet their day to day living expenses , rent an apartment
        , and have little savings and no investments . If such a person needed to
        go to a nursing home , Medicaid will almost immediately start picking up their
        tab and they will be fine . Long term care insurance is for those who have
        substantial assets or income that they do n't want to `` lose '' by paying
        high long term care costs . Some people are OK with their savings going to
        long term care expenses , if needed . They figure that is why they saved .
        Others feel strongly that they want to pass that wealth to heirs to continue
        a business , care for a disabled adult child , or help grandchildren go to
        college , among a myriad of other reasons . It is this latter segment of the
        population that `` needs '' long term care insurance , especially if they
        are not so very wealthy that paying nursing home expenses for many years would
        simply dent their resources , rather than deplete them . If they can afford
        long term care insurance , but would not be able to to pay for long term care
        services , people who are adamant about choosing the type of care they receive
        , or persons who are setting up a plan so that their children do n't have
        to worry about it , also could use long term care insurance . As long as Medicaid
        is around , no one absolutely needs long term care insurance . But for all
        the reasons above , many people would consider it a need if they looked at
        it realistically .
      - Is long term care insurance really necessary ? The answer depends on you and
        what you want to happen to you in a care situation . If you want a say in
        where you go , how you are treated and what you get to keep asset wise , Long
        Term Care makes great sense . You can certainly do without it , but understand
        you give up where you go , how you 're treated and very little if any choice
        in assets you get to keep . All a long term care policy does is give you control
        over how you 're treated when you need a care situation . So no , it is not
        necessary if that does n't matter to you . If it does , then it makes great
        sense . Long term care is an either you get it or you do n't product . Most
        purchasers of long term care WANT the product , very few have to be talked
        into making a purchase . It is one the few products in insurance where you
        spend a lot of time plugging together options for people as they 've already
        decided to purchase , so the question becomes what do they want it to do ?

      - People purchase long term care insurance because they want to protect their
        assets , and because they want to be involved in the decisions about what
        long term care they receive . Having a long term care insurance policy can
        pay the insured person funds that can be used to pay for a home health aid
        , personal assistant so they can live in an independent living residence ,
        or monthly charge for assisted living or nursing home . While it gives the
        person freedom to choose the care they are most comfortable with , it also
        allows them to hold onto their assets that might have to be spent on long
        term care , without insurance .
      - I believe you are referring to Long Term Care Insurance . There are a variety
        of different long term policies from many insurance companies . Most policies
        sold today are comprehensive and offer a daily benefit that can be used in
        your home , adult day service centers , hospice care , respite care , assisted
        living facilities and Alzheimer 's special care facilities and nursing homes
        . In a home setting , comprehensive polices generally cover skilled nursing
        care , occupational , speech , physical and rehabilitation therapy . You can
        also get help with personal care , such as bathing and dressing . In order
        to receive long term care expense reimbursement , you need to qualify . Generally
        , that means the failure of the insured to perform 2 out of 6 of the activities
        of daily living -LRB- ADLs -RRB- . There is also an `` elimination period
        '' after which the benefits begin . Policies vary in what they actually cover
        and there is much you should know about long term care and you need to find
        a qualified insurance agent near you that can help you understand it .
      - Stand alone long term care insurance policies can be very expensive and generally
        are not a fixed premium so may well go up over time . When you purchase long
        term care as a rider on a whole life policy you will get the lowest premium
        rate for it that is available . So really then the best time to buy long term
        insurance is when you 're buying a whole life policy . If you already have
        a whole life policy without the LTC rider , you could either buy an additional
        policy or exchange your current policy for a new one and add the LTC rider
        .
      - My clients who are over the age of 55 pay between $ 4,000 to $ 7,000 a year
        . These are clients that have no other assets to exchange for an asset based
        long term care annuity . My other clients who have large assets will exchange
        them for a long term care annuity with guaranteed benefits , guaranteed growth
        on the principle and a guaranteed death benefit . They do not have to use
        the annuity for a specific long term care need . It is just another to pay
        for long term care without losing principle . Long term care insurance is
        a racket . The riders , the definitions and some companies just do n't have
        a good contract for those who need to pay premiums instead of exchanging assets
        .
      - Why ca n't we buy health insurance across state lines ? What difference would
        it really make ? Insurance pricing , what you pay is based on the cost of
        care in your zip codes . There is no saving to be had from buying in another
        state , this is a confused myth created by people who do n't understand health
        insurance . The cost of your care is priced on where you live , not where
        someone else lives . Think about it for a second and it will start to make
        sense . Why would an insurance company underprice the premium in an area where
        medical claims costs are high ?
      - 'Long-term care insurance starts becoming more pricey during the mid-fifties
        . One should seriously consider buying their long-term care insurance before
        then . However , there are many solutions to the problem of possibly needing
        to pay for high-cost , end-of-life care . A careful search on the Internet
        will show a number of ways to accommodate that risk . The National Clearinghouse
        for Long-term Care is a good place to start : WEBSITELINK'
      - Long Term Care Insurance exists to pay for the care needed when the insured
        persons can no longer take care of themselves . To receive a long term care
        benefit , they must show that they can not do at least two ADL 's -LRB- activities
        of daily living -RRB- on their own , and it is usually required that the condition
        is anticipated to last for at least 90 days . It also will pay due to cognitive
        impairment that interferes with the ability to care for themselves . Disability
        Insurance does not require that you can not care for yourself in order to
        start receiving benefits . It just requires that you can not do your job .
        While Long Term Care benefits are chosen based on the cost of health care
        in that region , Disability benefits are based on the income brought in by
        your job .
      - 'Im going to answer your question this way : Im going to describe for you
        the kind of person who buys life insurance and is really glad they did . They
        are happy with the policy they bought ; they are happy with the process they
        went through to get that policy ; and they are happy to tell all their friends
        and neighbors about how happy they are with the purchase :-RRB- . These are
        the qualities of a happy life insurance shopper : Quality number one : the
        happy life insurance shopper dares to care . Look , life insurance is not
        for you , right ? Its for your beneficiaries . And frankly , some people could
        care less about what happens after they die . I mean , to put it bluntly ,
        they are dead , right ? Isnt that what it comes down to ? But for other people
        , the difference between being alive and being dead is not that great . I
        mean , you have spent a lifetime building something of value . Your marriage
        . Your family . Your business . Charitable causes worthy of your support .
        All these folks have become dependent on you . If you die , they could lose
        their economic foundation . But if you have insurance on your life , then
        they dont have to miss a dime . Life can go on in style for your spouse ,
        your children , your business partners , your employees , and all the needy
        people that are being helped by the charities you support . If you care about
        these people , then life insurance can make sure life goes on for them , even
        when your life does not go on for you . Quality number two : the happy life
        insurance shopper understands that the time to buy is now . Everyone knows
        we all die sometime . For most of us , though , death is something that happens
        to someone else - until it strikes home . Maybe someone close to us gets really
        sick , or we ourselves have a brush with death that wakes us up . But up to
        that point , we just dont want to think about it . We also convince ourselves
        that if we stay in shape , eat right , manage our stress , and maintain a
        good attitude , we can forestall the inevitable . The fact of the matter is
        that if we really thought about it , there are a whole slew of hazards that
        are entirely beyond our control . Heres a few that come to mind : Freak household
        accidents . Violent crime . Natural disasters . Car crashes . Of course we
        all say that odds are against any of these happening to us . We even say to
        ourselves that we can afford to wait and buy a policy next year or the year
        after , so we can qualify for a better rate . But in the meantime , things
        can happen . And they do . All the time . Unexpectedly . If your time comes
        before you have a policy in force , then your beneficiaries lose out . You
        really cant afford to die until that coverage is in place . Quality number
        three : the happy life insurance shopper wants a guaranteed return on his
        or her money . OK . Now you know you need to get coverage in force as soon
        as possible because you never know when your time will come . The next logical
        question is : for how long do you keep the coverage in force ? Easy answer
        : for as long as you live . You know at some point you will have your last
        day on this earth , so that means you know for sure your beneficiary will
        get their money when your time comes ... ... as long as the policy is still
        in force . That means you need permanent coverage . The policy should last
        as long as you do . Doesnt permanent coverage cost more then term coverage
        ? Yes . Isnt term good for short-term needs ? Yes . Can you buy term and then
        purchase permanent when you can afford it ? Yes . Does it make sense to buy
        term now and then convert to a permanent product ? Yes . The thing is , if
        you dont take a long-term strategy , then you wont be guaranteed a payout
        . If you do take a long-term strategy , then you will . Guaranteed by a top-flight
        financial institution . Quality number four : the happy life insurance shopper
        knows what hes getting into . When you buy a house , do you expect to write
        a check for the purchase price agreed on ? Of course you do . Same when you
        buy a business , book a cruise , and buy a pair of shoes . We even demand
        that a grocery store clerk honors the price on the shelf if an item has been
        mislabeled . Life insurance should operate the same way . Hard to believe
        , isnt it ? All too often , a broker will submit an application on the hope
        and prayer that the applicant will be approved at the rate quoted . We wont
        know what the price really will be until you are approved . Yes , right ,
        but if you go through full disclosure on a preliminary basis , you can become
        confident in what that price will be . The broker has to prequalify you and
        present carriers with thorough and accurate quote information upfront . They
        can then commit to a price , contingent upon information obtained in underwriting
        not contradicting the preliminary disclosures . You can then be sure of what
        you are buying . If you dont get prequalified , then you cant be sure . Simple
        as that . Quality number five : the happy life insurance shopper wants to
        be heard . There are a few companies out there who let consumers call them
        and buy policies . Thats nice for a tiny percentage of the zillions of men
        and women who need coverage . The rest of us need personalized service and
        a guide to walk us through the vast marketplace of potential carriers . Only
        one or two of them will be the best for us , and that broker has to lead the
        way to their doorstep . But life insurance distribution can be pretty rigid
        . The broker usually does not have direct access to the carriers . He or she
        must work through carrier general agencies who act as wholesalers of their
        products . So there is you , your broker , his or her general agent , and
        their carrier . I am sure you have played that telephone game where one person
        in the line passes down a message , and by the time it reaches the end , its
        completely different . Its the brokers job to make sure all information about
        you that is passed along the underwriting channels remains consistent and
        is fairly assessed . He or she is your advocate , and must be prepared to
        carry your cause over any and all hurdles that pop up in underwriting . And
        they do pop up . All the time . If you have been properly prequalified for
        coverage , then the bottom line is this : you should be approved at the rate
        quoted unless information arises in underwriting that is substantially different
        from the information that was disclosed on a preliminary basis . Your broker
        is your advocate to make sure that happens . In my humble opinion , this is
        how you buy life insurance . If you follow this path , you will be one happy
        camper :-RRB-'
      - Under Medicare any type of Home Health Care is limited . They will provide
        some skilled care on a temporary basis but Medicare generally will not pay
        for custodial care in any long term care environment . That is why it is important
        to carry some type of Long Term Care Insurance that will provide Home Health
        Care . Some policies even pay family members for providing care . A good agent
        who does long term care planning can help you find a program that will help

      - 'What ''s the importance of Renters Insurance ? If you ''re renting a house
        , condo , or an apartment , the last thing you ''re thinking about is renters
        insurance . Since you do n''t own the building , the landlord is covered ,
        and you do n''t value your personal belongings to really add up , what ''s

        your personal contents are destroyed . Now , all your belongings are gone
        and you do n''t have a place to sleep . Your home or apartment is burglarized
        ; you ''ve lost your laptop , mobile phone , entertainment system and flat
        screen TV . How about your more modern technology items such as a Tablet ,

        , and furniture . Here are some reasons to have renters insurance : BURGLARY
        . You may think your apartment is `` secure '''' ! Rental units are prime
        targets for theft and burglars are getting smarter about how to break into
        apartments and rental homes ; most of them do not have a security system and
        are not insured . FIRE OR SMOKE DAMAGE . The landlord ''s insurance wo n''t
        replace your furniture and personal belongings . Renters insurance will cover
        items damaged by fire , smoke , and other situations . WATER DAMAGE . Renters
        insurance may cover items caused by water damage . Additional living expenses
        . If your unit is damaged by water or fire , you ''ll likely need to find
        another place to live whether short or long term . Most policies include coverage
        for hotel expenses or assistance to find an alternate rental unit if you ca
        n''t live in your rental unit . LIABILITY INSURANCE . Renters insurance can
        cover injury to another person on your property . It can also include medical
        payments coverage that pays for expenses of guests . Inexpensive . Renters

      - 'How a renters policy is rated is no different than how any other homeowners
        policy is rented . There are several factors that go into the rating mechanism
        : Where you live - how far to the nearest fire station and fire hydrant The
        construction of the building - is it a brick building or a frame building
        -LRB- which do you think burns easier ? -RRB- Safety features - smoke alarms
        , deadbolt locks , fire/burglar alarms , sprinklers Your personal Property
        limit -LRB- your stuff -RRB- - the higher the values , the higher the premium
        Your personal Liability Limit - again , higher limits , higher premium Personal
        circumstances - age , credit score , claims history Renters insurance is really
        just a homeowners policy without building coverage . It ''s coverage for you
        and your stuff . The cost of renters insurance is usually much lower than
        a homeowners policy because a lot of the premium is generated by the cost
        of the building . Some guidelines to get the right renters coverage . Get
        a good handle on what it would cost to replace your stuff . A good agent can
        help or you can go to Allstate ''s website and use their tool -LRB- no , I
        ''m not an Allstate agent , I just like their tool -RRB- . Secondly , choose
        a higher liability limit . I usually quote at least $ 300,000 but prefer $
        500,000 or more . The cost is very negligible . Be smart , find an agent you
        can trust and take their advice . If you do have a claim , you ''ll be happy
        you did .'
      - Asking the question why should Renters get Renters insurance is the same as
        asking why should anyone get insurance ? The purpose of insurance is to pool
        together monies to reduce individual financial risk from unforeseen losses
        . Other than car insurance and now health insurance you do n't have to purchase
        insurance but I certainly would n't recommend it . Even if you are a millionaire
        you still need insurance . The more money you have the more money you can
        lose and the cost of insurance is minimal compared to the financial risk you
        face . Renters needs renters insurance to protect their belongings and also
        to provide liability protection for negligent acts . Renters insurance typically
        costs between $ 100 - $ 200 per year and for this cost you get coverage up
        to $ 25,000 for personal property and up to $ 300,000 in liability . The real
        question should be why would n't Renters get Renters insurance .
      - When you rent your home , it might seem like you dont need insurance . If
        the building gets damaged in an accident , it will be your landlords problem
        , not yours . However , just because you are renting your home doesnt mean
        you dont have anything at stake . There are a few important reasons why you
        should consider getting renters insurance . The first reason to get renters
        insurance is to protect your belongings . Your landlords insurance only covers
        his property . It will cover repairing the building and anything he owns in
        your home , but wont cover anything you own . If your property is destroyed
        by a fire or someone breaks in and steals your valuables , youll be on you
        own to replace everything . This can easily cost you thousands of dollars
        out of pocket . When you have renters insurance , it will cover these losses
        . Another reason to buy renters insurance is to protect yourself against lawsuits
        . If someone has an accident and get badly injured in your home , you as the
        renter could be liable . Renters insurance protects you against this liability
        and makes sure you dont lose a fortune in a lawsuit . Lastly , renters insurance
        is very inexpensive . Many policies cost less than a dollar a day . This means
        you can get this important protection without having to make a big financial
        commitment . WEBSITELINK
      - 'I am going to take a philosophical approach to answering this question .
        I think it would help you understand the value you are getting for your dollar
        with this product . Lets suppose that you know with absolute certainty you
        are going to die next Tuesday . No doubt about it . Was definitely going to
        happen . Sad to think about , but hey - we are talking about life insurance
        . Now lets suppose that an insurance company is willing to insure you . -LRB-
        Yes , I know its crazy , but work with me here . -RRB- And lets suppose they
        are willing to offer you a $ 1 million policy . Would that be enough ? OK
        , lets say it would be . How much would you be willing to pay for that $ 1
        million of coverage ? You know that the company is going to put out that money
        . The payout is guaranteed . And you know that the premium is going to be
        lower than the benefit . Even if you paid $ 900,000 for that $ 1 million dollar
        policy , you would still get a 10 % return on your money . By any standards
        , that is a good deal . If you had that money , no doubt you would pay it
        . And that would be a good deal for three reasons . One : your beneficiary
        would be getting money that was needed when they lose you . Two : there is
        an ironclad contractual guarantee from a very strong financial institution
        to give them that money . Three : the cost would be very reasonable and you
        would definitely get your dollars worth . All true ? So you would do everything
        possible to make this deal happen all because you know you are going to die
        next Tuesday . The only difference between this hypothetical scenario and
        real life is that you do not know when you are going to die . It could be
        tomorrow . It could be next Tuesday . I could be in 20 years . You just dont
        know . Otherwise , all factors remain exactly the same : You know you are
        definitely going to die sometime . You know your beneficiaries will need the
        money when they lose you . There is an ironclad contractual guarantee from
        a very strong financial institution to give them that money . The cost would
        be very reasonable and you would definitely get your dollars worth . The moral
        of the story is that regardless of the cost , life insurance virtually all
        the time remains a fantastic deal . You just have to be willing to pay for
        it . The better question is : what is the value of a good life insurance policy

      - You will find renters insurance to be very inexpensive . With most companies
        renter insurance covering approximately $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 in personal contents
        and $ 300,000 in personal liability to be approximately $ 150 to $ 300 dollars
        a year which is equivalent to about $ 12.50 to $ 25 dollars a month . Depending
        on the carrier this could vary . By writing a renters policy not only are
        you getting coverage for your personal belongings but you are also getting
        personal liability coverage . Some companies also include additional coverage
        such as host liquor liability , which you would need to rent halls for events
        like a wedding or a birthday . You may also be able to schedule things such
        as your cell phone which may or may not be cheaper then purchasing the coverage
        from your cell phone carrier . You will find that if you purchase your renters
        policy through the same carrier as your auto insurance that the discount you
        receive on your auto insurance will more than pay for your renters policy
        . Multi-policy discounts with some companies can range from 5 % -20 % or possibly
        more , which can save you hundreds on your auto insurance . So be sure to
        talk to your insurance agent about writing a renters policy and what discounts
        are available .
      - 'Yes , Yes & Yes !!! Although Renters Insurance is designed to protect the
        Personal Belongings of the Renter , the policy also includes Personal Liability
        Coverage . There have been endless numbers of cases in Small Claims Court
        where there are issues between Landlords and Renters following damage to rental
        units . With the presence of a Renters Insurance Policy , the insurance company
        will investigate the claim and find if in fact the renter ''s negligence caused
        the loss ; if so , the damage repairs will be covered by the tenant ''s personal
        liability section of the Renters Insurance Policy . In some States , the Renters
        Insurance Policy is a requirement under the conditions of the standard rental
        agreement ; however , it is prudent of Landlords to require Renters Insurance
        . As a rhetorical question : ` Would you wish to rent your property to a tenant
        not concerned with insuring their own belongings ? '' Renters Insurance is
        very inexpensive and contrary to common belief , you do n''t have to speak
        to a salesperson to obtain a quote and buy the insurance . In many States
        , the minimum coverage is $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 of Personal Property and the
        policy automatically comes with $ 100,000 of Personal Liability . Depending
        on your selected deductible , the premium may be as low as $ 100 per year
        . If you are responsibly cautious only about the liability issue , we would
        recommend selecting the highest deductible since this will generate the lowest
        premium ; the deductible does n''t apply to the liability section . For an

      - I do not see very many disadvantages to renters insurance . Lets look at the
        coverage renters insurance provides , and then we can talk about what it does
        not cover . Renters insurance is designed to cover your personal property
        , protect you if you are sued , and pay medical bills if someone is injured
        on your property . Most people get upset when their insurance does not cover
        something . Sometimes people file claims to pay their landlord for clean up
        their deposit did not cover -LRB- this is not covered -RRB- . Some agents
        use renters insurance as an ad on coverage and they choose how much coverage
        without consulting your need . If you have renters insurance and only have
        $ 10k of coverage when you needed more you will not be paid more than the
        $ 10k A common deductible on renters insurance policies is $ 500 , and often
        smaller theft claims do not exceed the deductible . I see this a lot in personal
        items stolen out of vehicles . I think the advantages of having renters insurance
        far out way not having it . People in our society sue for a lot of different
        things , and protecting your self from being sued for Bodily Injury or Property
        Damage out side of your Auto is an essential part of creating a sound financial
        plan . Just make sure you have the proper coverage before you buy .
      - Renter 's Insurance is not required by state law , but many landlords will
        require that you carry renter 's insurance as part of your lease agreement
        . This is because Renter 's Insurance comes with liability insurance protection
        , so , in some cases , if you damage the premises , they can collect from
        your Renter 's Insurance policy . That coverage usually applies for accidentally
        created fires -LRB- for example -RRB- . Fortunately , most people can buy
        Renter 's insurance for about $ 10 - $ 12 per month -LRB- it might be less
        and some basic policies only cost about $ 5.00 / month -RRB- . Send me an
        email and I can get you a rate !
      - If you can afford a financial loss of your personal items and can easily repurchase
        what may have been lost due to a potential event such as fire , water , wind
        , theft and so on as there are many perils that are covered then renters insurance
        is not necessary . If you can absorb the costs of a potential law suit for
        bodily injury and/or property damage that can run well into the thousands
        or hundreds of thousands even if the suit is only alleged then renters insurance
        is not necessary . If you can pay your loss of use -LRB- substitute housing
        -RRB- if you are potentially displaced from your home for a loss as mentioned
        above then renters insurance is not necessary . If you said no to any of these
        you may wish to consider renters insurance . Renters insurance has to be the
        most affordable insurance on the market that covers so much for so little
        .
      - To the best of my knowledge renters insurance is not required by any state
        or by the federal government . Whether or not renters insurance is mandatory
        for a specific premise is solely up to the landlord or property owner . It
        is ultimately there call as to have renters insurance as a requirement of
        the rental agreement that you sign . Renters insurance is typically very inexpensive
        so call a local agent to get pricing and secure coverage .
      - I could tell you the Christmas story . About how a father or mother bought
        life insurance to protect their spouse and their children , if there were
        to be gone from them . About how the life insurance would protect their family
        from having to find a way to pay the mortgage or having to sell the house
        and move from the local school , or maybe mom having to get a new job . But
        the most important part about having life insurance is just knowing that your
        loved ones are protected should you no longer be with them . Finding the right
        agent to listen to you and find out what you need , and having the best company
        , one that pays claims quickly , will give you a sense of relief and satisfaction
        . That 's what having life insurance is all about . Gary Lane , Registered
        Representative , New York Life , 949 797 2424 . Thank you .
      - Almost all auto and homeowners insurance carriers offer renters insurance
        . If you currently have your auto insurance through a local agent contact
        them about renters insurance . They will more than likely have a product available
        . If you combine your renters and auto insurance with the same carrier you
        will more than likely receive a discount on your premiums .
      - This is an interesting question . Select ahigh limit of liability . Nothing
        will ruin your day like a nasty lawsuit . Consider the limits available and
        take one of the higher amounts . Since most people are thinking about their
        personal property when they buy a renters policy , remember that at the time
        of claim , identifying the losses and verifying values is critical , so pictures
        and scanned receipts can make the entire process as painless as possible .
        That is how to get the most our of your renters policy .
      - 'My first bit of advise regarding HOW one should go about buying life insurance
        is to do a little research . The better informed you are about providers and
        the types of policies , the better chances are that you ''ll get the best
        policy for your needs and goals . Of course that will necessitate that you
        have a good handle on exactly what your needs and goals are ! But there may
        be some living benefits connected to some policies that you are n''t aware
        of , such as the cash value and wealth growth potential of Whole Life with
        a mutual company - not to mention the tax benefits . So you should confer
        with an experienced Insurance Adviser who will be able to help you determine
        your needs and goals , answer questions about insurance companies you are
        considering , and help you to implement the best policy for you . One question
        you may find important to get the answer to is how the provider you ''re considering
        handles policy loans . For some enlightening information on that topic please

      - Travelers Insurance Company has an excellent renters insurance policy . The
        Form HO-4 covers Personal Property and Personal Liability Insurance for the
        tenant -LRB- insured -RRB- . Renters Insurance is a very valuable coverage
        because it no only offers protection against damage to your personal property
        but also protection against negligence and personal liability cases that may
        be brought against you . One valuable example is if there is fire , smoke
        or water damage to the rented home or apartment unit , the property owner
        's insurance company will most likely attempt to collect damages from the
        tenant if they can prove negligence . In this case , Renters Insurance will
        provide the legal representation to handle the situation although the policy
        limit will apply . If you are not sure and do n't really want to commit to
        purchase renters insurance but may or may not be required to according to
        your lease agreement , the best way to generate the lowest annual premium
        is to select the minimum personal property coverage available , the lowest
        limit of personal liability and the highest available deductible for the policy

      - Lets suppose you own a business . Obviously you cant do everything yourself
        , so you need to hire people with special skills . Collectively you can get
        to where you want to go . The people with special skills might include a high-ranking
        executive . Might also include a highly skilled technician . Perhaps a top
        salesman . All these people play roles that are key to the operation . And
        you , as the entrepreneur of the enterprise , are very much a key person too
        . This is not to say that people who are not key do not bring value to the
        company and are not important . If all the business needed was key people
        , why would you hire anybody else ? But key people are the ones whose loss
        would create the biggest problems . Sales could go down . Vendors might not
        get paid . Clients might get nervous about orders being filled . Banks might
        think twice about lending money . You need to protect your business against
        the loss of these people . If any or all of them disappeared tomorrow , you
        need to be sure that your business can go full speed ahead . Employees , clients
        , prospects , vendors , lenders , investors , and everyone else related to
        your business , need to be reassured that business will take place as usual
        . And that takes money . If you have the exact amount of money you need exactly
        when you need it , then you could tell people to not worry . Orders will get
        filled . Bills will get paid . You can take the time needed to find the right
        replacement . And you dont want to have to set up an investment program to
        cover these people . Nor do you want to have to borrow the money . You want

      - For the vast majority of renters , a renters insurance policy is optional
        . Some landlords will require that the tenant own a renters insurance policy
        and name them as an additional insured . It is important to note , however
        , that as a renter you are responsible for injuries and accidents that happen
        on the rented property . You are also responsible for damage to the unit and
        if your property is damaged because of a covered peril , your landlord is
        not responsible to make you whole . Those are things that a renters policy
        does .

      - The amount of life insurance needed is really only limited by the income and
        assets being protected , insurability and the capacity to pay premiums . The
        maximum coverage most insurers will consider for someone under age 45 will
        be 25 times earned income . The earned income multiples grade down as you
        age . At older ages , net worth plays a bigger role in establishing maximum
        coverage . As for who would `` need '' the most , consider that ultra high
        net worth individuals will continue to buy life insurance for estate planning
        purposes as their wealth grows to deal with estate liquidity issues . At some
        point , insurer retention limits and reinsurance capacity limits are reached
        such that the theoretical limit of US life insurance coverage on an eligible
        life is about $ 250 million .
      - Those who need the greatest amount of life insurance are those who would have
        the greatest losses , numerically speaking , if they passed . Persons with
        very high incomes would need a very high amount of life insurance to replace
        their income in the event of their deaths . Owners of a highly valued business
        could purchase a very large policy to buy out the share of another owner who
        passes . A son could take out life insurance on his father so that he is able
        to purchase his father 's ranch when his father passes . Of course , needing
        a great amount of life insurance does not make the need any more important
        than for those who need lesser amounts . Sometimes $ 10,000 can mean as much
        to one beneficiary as $ 1,000,000 can mean to another .
      - This is a great question . The amount of insurance that a person needs is
        completely up to them . I have clients that want a low amount of coverage
        just to assure that they are buried properly and then I have clients that
        want half a million or more to assure that the house and cars are paid off
        and that the children are taken care of in the event of their death .

      - 'Video Transcript : Who has the greatest need for life insurance ? Everybody
        that has beneficiaries that they want to indemnify , cover , or protect from
        their own indebtedness . Maybe you have a mortgage ; maybe you have credit
        card debt or auto debt . You may have future obligations like college or retirement
        . Whatever you want to protect , you want to be able to make sure your beneficiaries
        receive the tax-free benefit of life insurance proceeds to take care of those
        obligations so that they ''re not saddled and suffer through financial liabilities
        that you incurred or you created . Remember , just a heads up ; you may even
        want to create this for charitable intent . Whatever your reasons are , who
        has the greatest need ? People have the greatest exposure .'
      - Those who have the greatest need for life insurance are people with few assets
        , but many financial responsibilities . In other words , if they died , the
        loss of their income would leave a gaping hole in the financial welfare of
        those they left behind , because there would be nothing else to replace it
        . Life insurance is a low cost way of covering that need .
      - The greatest exposure a renter has is personal injury by someone visiting
        the unit that you have rented . A lawsuit is a terrible thing and the expense
        can be devestating . The second greatest loss would be to have your personal
        property destroyed . The landlord is not responsible for your personal property
        so if coverage is desired , a renters policy is the way to provide that coverage
      - Medical care has a price . In the open market it is fixed by consumers who
        want a service and medical personnel who can deliver the service . The problem
        occurs when someone needs the treatment but can not or will not pay the price
        for the service . I say , Will not because every decision about spending is
        discretionary . Should society as a whole bear the responsibility for the
        medical care for every resident ? Should the nature of that care be regulated
        ? Should the source of funding be general ? Those are the most pressing questions
        when considering a universal health care system . Ultimately in a universal
        health care system there is a specified list of services and a funding mechanism
        that is not based upon need for medical services . You may need a procedure
        that isnt covered in the program . At the same time you might consider another
        procedure immoral or frivolous . Who is going to decide ? The idea of universal
        health care sounds very good until you understand that some medical services
        will probably not be covered . In the USSR dental hygiene consisted of inserting
        a fluorescent tube into the patients mouth and surgery was routinely conducted
        in a super-cold environment because anesthesia was not readily available .
        In that case , most Americans would consider the health care to be inadequate
        . However , it was available to all and at little or no direct cost to the
        consumer . Under most regimes universal health care becomes rationed health
        care . The best example is the army under war time conditions . It is called
        triage but it means that you treat those with the greatest likelihood of recovery
        before treating soldiers with graver injuries . While it might be the best
        utilization of manpower , the soldier with his leg blown off , might not like
        the wait and a narcotic shot is not going to make his family happy . The issue
        of who is going to pay for the universal health care system is the most sensitive
        . No one wants to see others in need . By the same token no one wants to pay
        the high bill for medical treatment . If the universal care is funded by general
        funds from taxes it will always be a political football . If it is paid by
        premiums paid by individuals there will always be a need to assist those unable
        to pay the premium . The problem really boils down to our expectations of
        treatment level , the availability and cost of that treatment and who is going
        to pay the price . Yes , it sounds like a great idea but it has many difficulties
        and when it is expected then the society will start to question the need for
        universal flat screen TVs , micro-wave ovens and wall-to-wall carpets . There
        really isnt an end unless you look at the Soviet Union and see how it ended
        .
      - 'The typical profile of a life insurance owner is someone who is a family
        breadwinner and has minimal savings . In other words , has dependents and
        debt . Term life insurance is by far the most appropriate kind of life insurance
        for the majority of people . Advantages of term life insurance - Generally
        lower cost than permanent insurance . - Offers higher coverage at a more affordable
        price . - Gives you the most coverage for the lowest cost - up to 30 years
        . - Ideal for younger families when the need for protection is greatest .
        People choose term life Insurance for covering specific needs that will disappear
        with time , such as : - Income replacement - Financial security for dependents
        - Mortgage protection - College funding - Final/burial expenses Use a needs
        life insurance calculator and get online quotes so that you can compare rates
        from top rated companies to get the lowest price . Important note : Beware
        of sites that ask you for your contact information before you can see quotes
        .'
      - Universal life insurance is a great option for the client who wants more protection
        than is offered by term , but does not want to go to the expense of a whole
        life policy . It gives the client the greatest amount of permanent death benefit
        for the least amount of cost .
      - There are several things to consider when purchasing life insurance . The
        first is insurable interest . Who stands to lose financially if you died today
        ? A spouse , children , loved one or even business partner ? Who would be
        left owing your debt or who depends upon your income ? Once you answer this
        question , next is how much is needed to satisfy this debt or income replacement
        ? Now how long would it take to cover this loss ? In other words , how long
        do you need to repay that debt or how long until your partner or loved one
        could earn their own income ? Once you have the answers to these questions
        it will become clear how much life insurance you need and how long do you
        need to carry it . I recommend using an experienced independent life insurance
        broker that can shop the market to find you the best coverage at the best
        price to cover your unique situation .
      - The amount and type of life insurance you need depends on what you want your
        life insurance to accomplish . If it is for a temporary need such as getting
        your kids through college or paying off your house , a Term policy is a reasonably
        priced way of getting that amount of coverage . If you want to pay for your
        funeral , a smaller , Whole Life or Guaranteed No Lapse Universal Life policy
        would be a better choice . You should work with an agent you trust to consider
        your needs , and who will shop among multiple choices to find your best price
        for the best policy to suit those needs .
      - You need disability insurance as `` paycheck protection '' . You should look
        at your current monthly budget and determine what needs to be covered if you
        were to lose your paycheck due to an accident or illness . 1 in 4 20 year
        olds will go on disability before they retire from work . You should look
        at the your expenses and determine what is the net amount of income that I
        could get by on . Many people have disability insurance through their employeer
        . You have to be careful because this policy is usually paid `` pretex ''
        and is taxed upon your drawing income . You need to check your employeers
        policy to determine what your benefits are for disability . Business Owners
        can get a disability policy to pay for their business income . What would
        happen to your business if you could not do what you do daily to generate
        income . Would you need to hire somebody ? You can get a policy to cover this
        . Would your business stop working and revenue dries up ? You may be able
        to cover this . You need to work with an independent agent to compare the
        rates and benefits of multiple companies as they treat each situation different
        . An example would be a Physician who might be offered more income during
        their disability with a particular company . You would need to check to see
        if you receive benefits if you can not work your current profession versus
        working at anything . All paychecks need protection . You should have your
        evaluated and deceide how you would do if you became disabled .
      - Which life insurance is better , Term or Whole Life ? It is a debate that
        has great points on both sides . In reality , most people need more life insurance
        than they can afford to purchase in Whole Life , but they do n't need that
        large amount of coverage for a lifetime . Term life is an economical choice
        for large amounts of coverage for relatively short amounts of time . On the
        other hand , most people need a small amount of final expense coverage , and
        this can not be Term insurance or there is a risk of it not being in effect
        at the time of death . Also , Whole Life can be used for estate planning ,
        business succession , and other permanent needs that justify the higher premium
        , especially when , as Ted stated , cash value builds up to offset it . There
        is no one right answer for everyone , but there are many choices . A good
        agent will guide you to find the best policy or policies for your unique needs
        , desires , and budget .
      - The BEST life insurance product is the one that meets your needs . Therefore
        , you must ask yourself ; What is the goal ??? Term and Permanent insurance
        are two different products for two completely different needs . Term insurance
        is a product for just that , a fixed term , with either a level premium for
        the selected term or an increase annual payment if you were to choose renewable
        term . Since the contract isfor a fixed period of time , premiums are typically
        a portion of what the same coverage would be with a Permanent product as there
        are no cash accumulation or surrender features , making it affordable for
        those who need it . Regardless , term insurance is great for those with a
        need for coverage in the event of a loss of life , for a fixed term , i.e.
        the income or performance of the insured will be relied on by others . Additionally
        , term insurance is a great way for families with a limited income , to protect
        and provide for the family and young children in the event of the loss of
        the family breadwinner or equally important , the caregiver -LRB- many ``
        breadwinners '' undervalue the benefit provided by the stay-at-home spouse
        and over look childcare costs ! -RRB- which will help with living and education
        expenses for the surviving family . In the future , these young families can
        always re-analyze goals and needs and when their income allows , and convert
        to a permanent product . Term is also very useful for businesses to protect
        themselves against the loss of production and revenue in the event of a death
        of a key employee . This type of insurance planning called Key-man coverage
        , is cost affordable when using term insurance . Lastly , many of the attractive
        riders that are issued with permanent life policies can also be issued with
        term policies . Permanent insurance is a product with virtually infinite uses
        depending on your needs . Permanent life insurance products are just that
        , permanent for the life of the insured , so long as the owner has paid a
        sufficient amount of premium to maintain the coverage . In comparison to term
        , permanent life insurance is more expensive in order to account for the cost
        of insurance in later years of the insureds life . However , there are multiple
        advantages to buying permanent coverage as soon as you can afford it when
        you are younger . Aside from a lower level premium amount to carry the policy
        to maturity , more time will allow for a larger accumulation of cash value
        in the policy . This cash value , accumulating at a tax-deferred rate that
        beats current treasuries , can also be accessed through policy loans and withdrawals
        in the event of emergency cash needs , can be used as collateral for business
        or personal loans and can also be used to support you during retirement ,
        assuming that the need for coverage has been reduced . There are two main
        forms of permanent coverage , Whole Life products and Universal Life products
        , each with their own attractive features including dividends , increasing
        death benefit , flexible premiums and crediting rates indexed to stock market
        performances . Before making the decision to purchase either , be sure to
        sit down for a -LSB- typically free -RSB- consultation with a licensed life
        insurance agent who will help you identify both your short term and longer
        term needs and goals . Together , you should be able to put together an effective
        plan that will blend affordability and proper protection to meet your life
        insurance needs .
      - It is really not the person being insured who needs life insurance . Rather
        , it is those they leave behind . If you have dependents who would suffer
        financially if you were to pass away , you probably need life insurance .
        If you owe money that your dependents would have a hard time paying off ,
        you probably need life insurance to pay off that debt or mortgage . Many people
        feel they have their affairs in order without the need of life insurance .
        The problem is , disasters or tragedies can chip away at those funds , and
        what you had hoped to be there , can be depleted before death occurs . That
        is where having at least some life insurance is necessary for most people
        .
      - Who needs permanent life insurance ? People with permanent needs . I.e. needs
        that will not end after a certain number of years . No one knows for certain
        when death will occur , so funeral expenses will need to be covered by permanent
        life insurance if the goal is to pay off the funeral with life insurance .
        Leaving an inheritance to children or grandchildren will require permanent
        life insurance . If you have Term insurance , pass away after it expires ,
        and can not qualify for or afford a new policy , the money you planned to
        leave your family will be gone . Most people do n't need all their life insurance
        in permanent policies , because some of their life insurance needs will be
        temporary . But when the need will not go away until death , permanent life
        insurance is the only sure solution .
      - 'This is one of the most commonly asked questions about life insurance . I
        agree with Larry that there is no specific answer . Most studies suggest many
        have no life insurance at all and of those who do , many are underinsured
        . We often meet with clients who have less than one times their current annual
        income . Insurance companies generally approve coverage amounts up to 25X
        income -LRB- under age 45 -RRB- . There are many calculators online which
        can help such as this one : WEBSITELINK But there is no substitute for an

      - Medicare standard is primary to Tricare in all cases . Medicare Part D , if
        you elect it is also primary to Tricare . If you have a Medicare Advantage
        plan , let both Tricare and your MA know about the other , and they will organize
        the coordination of benefits . One important thing to remember is that , if
        you have Medicare Part A and Tricare , in most cases you will also have to
        be enrolled in Medicare Part B to keep the Tricare coverage .
      - If you are eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A , you must have both
        Part A and Part B to continue to receive TRICARE . Once you start receiving
        Part A and B , you start receiving TRICARE benefits under TRICARE for Life
        -LRB- TFL -RRB- . There is no advantage for most TRICARE recipients to enroll
        in Medicare Part D because TFL 's drug benefits are so comprehensive .
      - When you have original Medicare -LRB- Medicare Part A & Part B -RRB- and TRICARE
        , Medicare is the primary insurance . TRICARE pays second -LRB- the idea being
        to lower your out of pocket expenses -RRB- . Please note , I believe you have
        to have both Part A & Part B of Medicare to keep TRICARE benefits when you
        go on Medicare , but you should double-check with the plan to be 100 % sure
        . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me via my
        profile page with any other questions . Thanks very much .
      - If you are currently on Tricare you will be required to enroll in Medicare
        parts A & B when you reach age 65 . In most cases this happens automatically
        . The part B has a charge . When you have a claim the claim is processed first
        by Medicare . They pay the benefit on their schedule . The balance of the
        bill is then sent to Tricare . Tricare then pays what they will pay subject
        to any applicable deductibles and co-payments . The balance is then due and
        payable by you . In practice most physicians and hospitals get complete information
        about how the bill will be handled before they treat you . If you are responsible
        for any part of the bill , they will demand payment , frequently , before
        treatment starts .
      - Tricare is never primary over Medicare . It will only pay after all other
        insurances have paid . If you have Tricare and are entitled to Part A , you
        must have Part B to continue the Tricare pharmacy benefits . However you do
        not have to enroll in a Part D prescription plan . If you do choose to enroll
        in a Part D plan , Tricare will be secondary to that plan as well .
      - Tricare , formerly known as CHAMPUS , provides civilian benefits for military
        personnel , and their dependents . Tricare for Life -LRB- TFL -RRB- was designed
        to offer secondary coverage to Medicare for all who have Medicare Part A and
        Part B . There are very few ways one can have Tricare without having Part
        B . Here is a helpful link to explain TFL and Medicare . WEBSITELINK
      - Active military and National Guard are covered by TRICARE , a health care
        program for service members and their families around the world . TRICARE
        is the major part of the Military Health System , a system that utilizes combined
        resources of military hospitals and clinics with civilian health care networks
        , as well as a combination of different coverage options depending on where
        the person is currently stationed . TRICARE coverage does meet the requirements
        for having minimum essential benefits as called for under the Affordable Care
        Act .
      - Tricare , formerly known as CHAMPUS , is a health care program of the U.S.
        Dept of Defense Military Health System . TFL , Tricare for Life , offers secondary
        coverage to Medicare for all beneficiaries who have both Medicare Parts A
        and B . There are very few incidences where one can get this coverage without
        having Part B , and those incidences are temporary .
      - Most branches of the Military on on TriCare and it covers anything medically
        necessary . Without understanding the specifics being asked here and not having
        enough room to write everything that 's covered ... this type of group plan
        will cover any and all medically necessary services that are n't excluded
        in the policies limitations and exclusions . TriCare is excellent coverage
        if you have access to it .
      - Only you can answer that question . Figure your fixed costs after retirement
        , your plans -LRB- do you plan to travel ? -RRB- , and other individual factors
        . Also deduct out social security if you want to figure out how much additional
        savings you need to meet your goal . My opinion is at least 80 % of current
        income on average but that is not written in stone , every case is different
        . Sit down with a good agent familiar with retirement planning . He or she
        can help you put together a good plan for a comfortable retirement .
      - Yes it is legal , all insurance is regulated by the state insurance commissions
        , so anything Allstate is doing has been approved by them . First thing you
        should do now is contact a local independent agent and have them quote you
        with multiple carriers that can compete for your business . Typically the
        insurance companies are going to want your home and auto bundled together
        . This also gives you the most discount opportunities . Every insurance company
        will work with your mortgage company to get the premium paid .
      - 'This is a relatively subjective question . There are many companies that
        sell some form of Critical Illness . A question I would ask if you were working
        with me is are you looking for a stand-alone policy or a policy that has more
        value as in attached to your Life Insurance ? I recommend three different
        companies , Assurity Life , Mutual of Omaha and Transamerica which depending
        on what you are looking for , which is a bigger question . I would contact
        an agent or you can reach out to me and I can put together a quote for you
        . Matt - -LRB-720-RRB-708-5498 or email me at : matt@pegasusii.com'
      - None that I know of will underwrite a mentally impaired person . It goes back
        to basic contract law and both parties being of sound mind to contract together
        . In fact when dealing with seniors these days an agent must be sure the senior
        is of sound mind when doing any financial work . Often , a agent will include
        family members of the client in the discussion . Dementia is something that
        can come on quickly and courts have ruled against agents who may have sold
        products to seniors who not much later on , suffered from dementia .
      - Great question ! Unfortunately , unless the person to be insured is very young
        -LRB- think under 16 -RRB- they are going to have to sign the application
        as the `` insured '' . The laws governing the issuing of insurance were set
        up especially to prevent person A from taking out a policy on person B without
        them being aware , to protect person B. I 'd be happy to explain in more detail
        if you 'd like , just contact me . I 'd suggest the best solution is that
        you work out whatever issues there are with dad , and proceed together . Thanks
        for asking !
      - The cheapest long term care insurance company in Colorado varies according
        to the person who is applying . Some companies are better at older ages ;
        some are better for couples . Some are better for -LRB- or are the only ones
        that will take -RRB- certain health conditions . Some offers certain features
        at a lower price than others . To find the cheapest long term care insurance
        for you , contact an agency that sells a variety of long term care companies
        in Colorado and review your health and all the features offered with a knowledgeable
        agent . Together , you can work out which has the lowest price for what you
        qualify for and what you need .
      - Work with a good independent agent that can show you what the current cost
        of care is in your area . For example , I would put together figures that
        would show you what the average cost of home healthcare , assisted living
        and a nursing home would run . I would then take those numbers into account
        when preparing a long term care insurance benefits package . Since you will
        not need the care for several years you need to have a plan that factors in
        future inflation .
      - Home fire insurance works on the basis of shared risk . An insurance company
        brings together people with similar risks so that they can share losses if
        there are any . Since such a group would have houses of different values ,
        locations , and exposures , the company uses statistics and experience to
        develop rates that would apportion the risk to the various houses . If in
        a particular pool the total exposure or risk is $ 1 billion dollars , your
        portion of the actual risk might be only $ 700 .
      - To add to both I would suggest by passing the underwriting all together and
        go for a Group Policy that I offer to individuals through a membership . You
        must be working 30 hours or more per week , and live in the USA and it is
        available in all but 4 states . You can have up to $ 100,000 and it is only
        graded for one year and to give you an idea of the cost for a 49 year old
        it would be $ 88.55 per month for $ 100,000 in coverage . Contact me for more
        information .
      - Life insurance pricing appears to be wildly different and yet it is working
        with exactly the same mortality experience and with interest and expenses
        that are remarkably similar . What you really end up comparing is length of
        coverage . You can buy a policy that will cover you for 1 year and you can
        buy one that covers you to death , regardless of when that might occur . An
        insurance agent is the best source of information about life insurance policies
        . After listening to you , offering financial advice they should be able to
        put together exactly the policy that you need at the price you can afford
        .

      - The purpose is to provide financial coverage for the `` gaps '' in original
        Medicare Parts A and B. Original Medicare is very good health insurance ,
        however does not pay for all beneficiary health care costs . For example ,
        Medicare Part A -LRB- Hospitalization -RRB- requires beneficiary payment of
        a $ 1,260 deductible in 2015 . The Part B -LRB- Doctors costs -RRB- has a
        $ 147 annual deductible , plus requires the beneficiary to pay 20 % coinsurance
        of the Medicare approved amount for the bills . There are other exposure items
        as well , but it is easy to see that a given health situation could potentially
        lead to some significant bills for the beneficiary even though they have insurance
        . Medigap Insurance is designed to pay these bills in exchange for the payment
        of a monthly premium , thus trading an uncertain potential financial exposure
        for a certain monthly payment . It 's a good idea to find a licensed insurance
        agent who is experienced in Medicare plans to assess your needs and objectives
        and offer optimal solutions to limit your financial exposure .

      - Medigap Insurance is for the gaps of coverage in Medicare Part A and Part
        B . You buy a Medicare Supplement or Medigap Insurance for this purpose .
        Medigap Insurance is a Medicare Supplement . These policies come in different
        levels that are determined by theGovernment . Each policy with the Letter
        corresponding to it is the same amount of coverage of the Medigap in MedicarePart
        Aand Part B.
      - What is the primary purpose of life insurance ? What everthe policy owner
        wants it to be . Every purpose can be different . While dating myself a little
        bit by saying this . . Life insurance is the silly putty of financial products
        . It is a product that has many forms and can be used in many ways . One person
        's primary purpose may be someone else 's 5th choice . It 's not unheard of
        to start a first time client meeting with the question `` what do you want
        your life insurance to do ? ''
      - Yes ! Medicare will cover an Echo if your doctor orders it for diagnostic
        purposes . An Echo is covered under Medicare Part B. Medicare will pay for
        about 80 % of the costs after the Part B deductible is met -LRB- $ 147 in
        2014 -RRB- - you would be responsible for the other 20 % and the Part B deductible
        . When you first enroll in Medicare Part B , you open your 6-month initial
        open enrollment period to buy a Medicare supplement plan -LRB- a.k.a. Medigap
        plan -RRB- with NO MEDICAL UNDERWRITING ! . A Medigap plan can cover the deductibles
        and a portion or all of the other 20 % of expenses covered by Part B and features
        a number of other big advantages as well . An experienced Medigap broker can
        help find the Medigap plan and carrier that 's most suitable for you and your

      - The main purpose of life insurance is to protect your family or business from
        the costs associated with your death . When a funeral causes relatives to
        have to pool their resources to pay for it , that is a purpose where life
        insurance could have helped . When a business must be sold to an outside party
        because a relative can not afford to buy it , that is a purpose where life
        insurance could have helped . When a family must go on welfare because the
        breadwinner passed away , that is a purposed where life insurance could have
        helped .
      - what is the purpose of whole life insurance ? Whole life insurance has many
        purposes for many people . They do n't even have to have the same needs .
        I can speak as to why I own whole life , I own Whole life because I wanted
        my life insurance to be inforce when I die . I wanted a safety net for my
        other investment activities . I wanted control of my policy . I wanted something
        that will not go backward , once the money is there , it is there . I wanted
        not to have to buy life insurance later in life as the price no matter what
        type of policy goes higher . I wanted something that would not end , until
        I do . Those are just a few of the purposes behind my decision 25 years ago
        to buy whole life , and I forgot to mention I wanted a locked in premium .
      - You can buy a Medigap policy through a Medigap insurance agent - I highly
        recommend doing it through an independent agent who can shop your case among
        many carriers instead of just 1 or 2 through a captive agent -LRB- agents
        who are basically employees of a specific company and ca n't guarantee if
        you 're paying the lowest cost for a standardized Medigap plan -RRB- . You
        can apply for a Medigap plan up to 3 months before your Medicare Part B effective
        date - you must have both Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B to buy a Medigap
        plan . Once you have an established Medicare Part B effective date , you will
        have a 6-month open enrollment period to buy any Medigap plan from any carrier
        with NO medical underwriting - this is THE BEST time to buy a Medigap plan
        . After this point , you can buy a new Medigap plan whenever you would like
        -LRB- there are no annual enrollment periods for Medigap plans -RRB- , however
        , you would have to go through medical underwriting if you do n't qualify
        for a special enrollment period or a guaranteed-issue right . Determining
        which Medigap plan is right from you and which carrier to apply for the plan
        through can be a bit more involved than some may realize . It 's not all about
        price as some may believe . You need to look at the carriers ' premium rating
        methods -LRB- community , attained , or issue age rated -RRB- , their rates
        , their rate increase history , their service history , and other factors
        . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance
        with your Medigap coverage needs , including providing quotes and plan comparisons
        , and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
      - These are two very different products that serve 2 different purposes so it
        ca n't be said whether one is better than the other . 401k 's are generally
        funded to be used for retirement savings purposes that can be accessed during
        your senior/retirement years . During your working life , many employers will
        offer to match all or a portion of the funds you place into your 401k -LRB-
        varying on a number of factors -RRB- . The intended purposes of whole life
        insurance are to create large sums of money quickly in the event the insured
        dies . It 's typically used as a form of protection to pay off debts -LRB-
        so your family is not burdened with those expenses -RRB- , provide income
        to a surviving spouse , leave a legacy to the insured 's loved ones , etc.
        . While whole life insurance does build cash value that you can borrow against
        , it 's actually creating a loan against the policy and is expected to be
        paid back -LRB- interest would be charged like you would have on a loan from
        a bank -RRB- . Cashing out a policy can be done , but you lose the protection
        of the life insurance and you may be subject to surrender charges and/or taxes
        on any gains -LRB- cash value amount is higher than total premiums paid into
        the policy -RRB- . When you buy life insurance , you 're buying it for the
        purposes of the death benefit protection - it 's not typically considered/used
        as an investment/retirement savings vehicle .
      - It depends a lot on which Medigap Plan you have . Medigap Plans are designed
        to cover most of what original Medicare Part A & Part B does not cover . However
        , all Medigap Plans do not have prescription drug coverage . You would need
        to get a Part D plan in addition to cover prescriptions . This is a good thing
        because you will be able to change your drug plan as your prescription needs
        change without needing to change your Medigap Plan . Medigap Plans also do
        not cover dental and vision , however , you can get a separate dental/vision
        plan . The quickest way to find out what Medigap Plans cover and is to go
        to our website . You can compare Medigap Plans instantly online at SummitMedigap.com

      - The original purpose of Life Insurance - the reason it was created is to transfer
        the risk of a person dying too soon from that person and their loved ones
        to the insurance company . Generally if a person dies while still having debt
        or not having enough money to care for their heirs , that person has `` died
        too soon '' . In a lot of people 's opinions dying at any time is too soon
        ! But that 's a philosophical consideration . Over time Permanent Life Insurance
        has come to play an important part in the financial well-being of insureds
        while living . Term insurance on the other hand remains solely for the purpose
        of insuring against a person dying too soon . Peggy listed a number of uses
        for Permanent Life Insurance , and I would add that the cash value of whole
        life insurance is a terrific asset for use in personal banking applications
        . For more information see WEBSITELINK
      - No , technically it 's not . Part C is also referred to as Medicare Advantage
        . So , when people are deciding on coverage they will either go the Medigap
        Plan route or the Medicare Advantage route . Medigap Plans cover what Medicare
        Part A & B do not and there are a lot of plans to pick from . For example
        , with Medigap Plan F , you would have no coinsurance , no deductibles and
        no copays . So , you budget the monthly premium that works for you and then
        you do n't have to worry about large out of pocket medical bills that come
        when you do n't expect it . Medigap Plans also do n't have a network so you
        can see any doctor or hospital you want . If they take Medicare , they will
        take the Medigap Plan regardless of who the carrier is . I would be happy
        to answer any other questions you have .
      - United Healthcare is an insurance company that offers senior products including
        Medicare supplements and others - they are the largest insurance company in
        the industry . Medicare is a government-run senior health insurance program
        . Even though Medigap plans are standardized , it 's not all about price and
        there are many parts that are often overlooked/not considered when evaluating
        and comparing plans . UHC has an agreement with AARP to attach their name
        to certain products -LRB- a common one seen is AARP Medigap plans -RRB- .
        The great advantage with the AARP Medigap plans -LRB- insured through United
        Healthcare -RRB- is they use the community-rated pricing method as opposed
        to the attained-age method most Medigap carriers use . The community-rating
        states that everyone in a given group -LRB- e.g. zip code -RRB- pays the same
        rates regardless of age , meaning an 85 year old can be paying the same thing
        as a 75 year old -LRB- which means major savings over the long run -RRB- .
        They also offer some of the most lenient medical underwriting for Medigap
        plans so for individuals with complex medical histories , the UHC/AARP Medigap
        plans can be a great product for your health insurance needs . I hope the
        information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help or if you

      - A Medigap plan , also known as Medicare Supplement insurance , is sold by
        private companies to help off-set the cost of some health care expenses not
        covered by Original Medicare does n't cover , like co-payments , coinsurance
        , and deductibles . One other huge benefit of any Medigap plan is the extension
        of your hospital coverage -LRB- paid under Medicare Part A -RRB- by an additional
        365 days . Some Medigap policies also offer additional coverage for services
        that Original Medicare does not cover , such as medical care when you travel
        outside the U.S. . If you have Original Medicare and you buy a Medigap policy
        , Medicare will pay its share of the Medicare-approved amount for covered
        health care costs . Then your Medigap policy pays its share . In most states
        , there are ten standardized Medigap plans , known by letters A through M.
        Regardless of that state in which you reside , or the company you purchase
        Plan A will always provide the exact same coverage as any other Plan A . The
        most popular plan is F , which covers 100 % of all patient cost sharing for
        Medicare-covered expenses . Plan G is also a popular option , often significantly
        cheaper than Plan F , with almost the exact same coverage -LRB- G covers everything
        F does , expect your Medicare Part B deductible -RRB- .
      - You should buy your Medigap plan when you 're new to Medicare - this is THE
        BEST time to buy a Medicare supplement plan because you have a 6-month window
        -LRB- your initial open enrollment period - starts from your Medicare Part
        B effective date -RRB- to apply for any Medigap plan with NO medical underwriting
        . This means that a carrier can not decline you for coverage for any pre-existing
        conditions or other medical-related illness . Beyond this window , you 'll
        be subject to answering health questions to qualify for a new plan -LRB- every
        carriers ' questions are different -RRB- if you do n't have a guaranteed-issue
        right available to you . Anyone over the age of 65 and has Medicare Part A
        & Part B can buy a Medigap plan . If you 're under 65 , you can still purchase
        a Medigap plan if you 're on Medicare for disability or ESRD , but the cost
        will be very high . Medigap plans are designed to be purchased by individuals
        age 65 and up . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact
        me for assistance with your Medigap coverage , quotes , and comparisons of
        plans and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
      - Medigap and Part C are not the same . Medigap is supplemental coverage to
        your Original Medicare Part A and B . You do n't have to buy a Medigap Plan
        , it is optional . Many people , however , use the Medigap Policy to help
        cover the 20 % of Medicare approved costs not covered by Part A and B. Medicare
        Supplement insurance is private insurance in which you pay a premium every
        month . You are allowed to visit any provider who accepts Medicare . Part
        C is called a Medicare Advantage Plan . It acts like an HMO or PPO , so you
        are restricted to using network doctors . This type of Plan combines Part
        A , Part B , and usually Part D -LRB- drug coverage -RRB- . It 's important
        to note , if you join a Medicare Advantage Plan , you do n't need and ca n't
        be sold a Medigap Policy . In other words , you ca n't buy a Medigap Policy
        to supplement your Part C -LRB- Medicare Advantage Plan -RRB- . Thank you
        for taking the time to read my reply . Please let me know if I can be of further
        assistance .
      - These two plans are nearly identical as there is only 1 difference between
        the benefits - coverage of the Medicare Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014
        -RRB- . Plan F is the most comprehensive plan as it covers all available Medigap
        benefits at 100 % from day 1 including the Part B deductible - Plan G does
        not cover the deductible and must be paid out-of-pocket . When comparing the
        two plans , you want to look at the price differential at the carrier -LRB-
        s -RRB- offering them at the lowest cost . If the difference in annualized
        premiums between plan F and plan G is more than $ 147 , than plan G will be
        the plan you should select - if it 's less than $ 147 , then you should select
        plan F. Please note , Medigap plans are standardized meaning the benefits
        are exactly the same regardless of which insurance company you buy your Medigap
        plan from . Every carrier has to pay the benefits the same way . If it 's
        your first time buying a Medigap plan or you already have one and want to
        lower your monthly premium , you should consult with an independent Medigap
        insurance broker who can shop the case for you among many companies to ensure
        you 're paying the lowest possible price for your plan . I hope the information
        is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with your Medigap plan
        and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .

- - - episode_done: true
      eval_labels:
      - Diagnostic testing is covered under Part B . You will pay 20 % of the Medicare
        approved amount . So if the procedure costs $ 1000 , Medicare approves $ 500
        you would pay $ 100 . Some states will allow an additional 15 % of what is
        called excess charges . If you live in Ohio , you do not have to worry about
        that , however if you live in Florida you would have to pay . The doctor can
        not balance bill you more that the 15 % of the Medicare approved amount .
      - Medicare has a set fee schedule for every procedure , including diagnostic
        testing , X-ray , CT , MRI and so forth . If you use a medical provider that
        accepts assignment they can not balance bill you and your out of pocket for
        medically necessary testing will be limited to your Medicare deductibles and
        coinsurance .

        accepts assignment they can not balance bill you and your out of pocket for
        medically necessary testing will be limited to your Medicare deductibles and
        coinsurance .
      - Medicare will pay for a medically necessary CT scan . Your doctor must document
        why the scan is needed . Medicare does not publish their fee schedules but
        you can get an idea of how much Medicare will pay for a CT scan if you Google
        Medicare DRG rates or Medicare payment schedule .
      - In order for the CT scan to be covered by Medicare , it must be deemed medically
        necessary via doctor 's orders , and Medicare must agree with the order .
        The Computerized Axial Tomography -LRB- CT -RRB- scan must be performed by
        a health care provider who participates in Medicare . Medicare Part A covers
        CT scans performed in a hospital or skilled nursing facility ; Medicare Part
        B covers CT scans performed as an outpatient .
      - Depending on your policy the general answer is yes . How much it covers depends
        on your policy and the reason for the CT scan . I recommend checking with
        your insurance company to find out if the procedure is covered before having
        the CT scan done . It could save you paying out money you were n't counting
        on .
      - Most major medical health insurance policies will cover CAT -LRB- CT -RRB-
        scans , as well as PET , MRI and X-rays ... all of which are diagnostic tests
        . Because CT scans can be quite expensive , if the carrier decides the scan
        was not the most cost effective method of diagnosing a condition , the claim
        may be denied .
      - Private health insurance plans to cover CT also known as CAT scans when the
        procedure is considered medically necessary as a diagnostic tool . CT scans
        are quite expensive and sometimes overused by doctors when a less expensive
        test could yield the desired information . If in question , and this is a
        non-emergency situation , consult with your insurance carrier before scheduling
        the scan .
      - As a general rule health insurance does cover CT scans . It may be listed
        under your `` xray section '' of the policy . If your membership card has
        a customer service phone number you should be able to call the company and
        givee all your policy information and the details of the scan and they can
        tell you what is covered
      - Medicare does not publish their fee schedule to the public , but you can get
        an idea of the Medicare allowance for MRI , CT scans , etc. . You can check
        out healthcarebluebook dot com as a resource and get an idea of fees . You
        can also Google Medicare DRG rates or Medicare payment schedule for information
      - Yes , you can drop Medicare Part B , but why would you want to ? Medicare
        Part B is for more than just doctor visits . Part B also covers outpatient
        diagnostic testing , labs , X-ray , CT scans , MRI , Emergency Room , ambulance
        and much more . Chemotherapy is also a covered Medicare Part B expense .
      - Talk to your Insurance Professional about your Home Insurance policy and what
        specifically may cause the premium to increase in your case . In general ,
        there are a number of factors that can contribute to a premium increase .
        For example , it is likely that your policy has an `` inflation guard '' provision
        that increases the dwelling amount provided each year . If the dwelling amount
        on your home increased over last year , that would certainly account for a
        premium increase . If you suffered a covered loss and had to file a claim
        , that might affect your renewal premium . If your area was hit with heavy
        weather related losses , like the ice daming that the North East and specificlally
        CT was plagued by , even if yo were not affected , your company might have
        had to take a rate adjustment as a result of the losses . Your Insurance professional
        wil be able to review your coverage and advise you not only as to why the
        policy may have increased , but also ways to save .
      - First of all , there is no federal long-term care program . If a person is
        or becomes `` indigent '' by state standards , they may qualify to have their
        long-term care facility expenses paid for by Medicaid -LRB- Medical in CA
        -RRB- . There is a commission in Washington currently debating if there will
        be a federal long-term care program , but they will have no power to institute
        one and it 's doubtful that given our current budget deficit , a comprehensive
        program could be afforded by either the states or the feds -LRB- Medicaid
        is a jointly funded and administered medical program for the poor -RRB- .
        Private long-term care programs at this point in time consist of applying
        to an insurance company and going through full underwriting to determine insurability
        . If so , they are issued a long-term care policy of insurance . Only insurance
        agents that are certified to sell long term care -LRB- most states -RRB- can
        do so . There is a Partnership long-term care program in 36 states -LRB- plus
        charter Partnership programs still going in CA , CT , NY , and IN -RRB- .
        The state departments of health `` partner '' with the person with a Partnership-approved
        long-term care plan of insurance so that if they blow through the insurance
        policy maximum benefits and are still alive , the amount of the payout from
        the insurance company will increase the impoverishment threshold dollar-for-dollar
        for that person and if the insured 's personal non-exempt assets are lower
        than what the insurance company has paid out , Medicaid will take over payment
        of the person 's long-term care costs until s/he dies.Note that there are
        some limitations1 . The person needs to be in a facility for full payment
        of costs by Medicaid . -LRB- Home care reimbursement from Medicaid is under
        $ 300/mo . -RRB- 2 . A lien in the amount of money paid out by Medicaid is
        levied against the patient 's estate . -LRB- This is currently being debated
        and is a point of contention with some states and consumer groups . Whether
        it will actually be done is not certain , but it 's `` on the books '' . -RRB-
        3 . While there is a promise that no discrimination will be made between ``
        Medicaid patients '' and `` paying patients '' in nursing facilities , audits
        of some facilities have found that there are , in fact , `` Medicaid rooms
        '' and regular rooms . When discovered , those facilities are supposedly ordered
        to make no distinction in treatment , care , or placement of patients based
        on their ability to pay.At this time , it is clear that there is a looming
        problem of how to take care of the elderly of the boomer generation as that
        demographic bubble passes through old age . And , though medical technology
        allows people to live longer , that life is not necessarily better . No solution
        has yet been proposed at the federal level . The problem will fall to Medicaid
        for now . Recent surveys have shown that only about 7-8 % of the population
        owns its own long-term care insurance . Some calculations indicate that Medicaid
        is solvent for only another 8-10 years as currently administered .
      - The cost of life insurance can range from a few dollars per month to many
        thousands per month . The real question is how much would it cost you to get
        the proper policy for your situation . In order to find that out you need
        to first determine how much death benefit you need . The best way to calculate
        how much life insurance you need is by doing a comprehensive needs analysis
        . If you are looking for a quick rule-of-thumb , we recommend you carry at
        least ten times your annual income in life insurance . The second factor is
        how long do you think you will need the coverage . You might want life insurance
        to cover your mortgage which will be paid off in a certain period of time
        , or you might want life insurance just until your children are grown and
        self supporting . Maybe you want to have life insurance for whenever you die
        , be it next year or when you 're 90 . The third key factor is your budget
        . You might like the idea of a large permanent life insurance policy , but
        the premium may simply be more than you can reasonably afford . So in order
        to determine how much life insurance costs per month , you need to figure
        out how much life insurance you need , how long you need it and what your
        budget allows . By going through this process you can determine how much the
        proper life insurance policy for you will cost .
      - life insurance proceeds are payable to an insureds estate , is their value
        includable in the insureds estate - The entire value of the proceeds must
        be included in the insureds gross estate even if the insured possessed no
        incident of ownership in the policy , and paid none of the premiums . -LSB-
        1 -RSB- But proceeds payable to an executor in his or her individual capacity
        rather than as executor for the insureds estate were not treated as payable
        to the insureds estate by the Tax Court . -LSB- 2 -RSB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- . IRC
        Sec . 2042 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; Est. of Bromley v. Comm. , 16 BTA 1322 -LRB- 1929
        -RRB- . -LSB- 2 -RSB- . Est. of Friedberg v. Comm. , TC Memo 1992-310 . When
        are life insurance proceeds that are payable to a beneficiary other than the
        insureds estate includable in the insureds estate ? Proceeds are includable
        in an insureds gross estate if the insured legally possessed and could legally
        exercise any incidents of ownership at the time of the insureds death . It
        does not matter that the insured did not have possession of the policy and
        therefore was unable to exercise his or her ownership rights at the time of
        his or her death , -LSB- 1 -RSB- or that the insured was unable as a practical
        matter to effect any change in the policy because the policy was collaterally
        assigned . -LSB- 2 -RSB- The proceeds are includable even if the insured can
        not exercise his or her ownership rights alone , but only in conjunction with
        another person . -LSB- 3 -RSB- It has been held that an insured did not possess
        incidents of ownership where the insured had paid no premiums , did not regard
        the policy as the insureds own , and had made an irrevocable designation of
        beneficiary and mode of payment of proceeds . -LSB- 4 -RSB- But even if the
        proceeds are payable to a beneficiary other than the insureds estate , and
        the insured possesses no incidents of ownership in the policy , the proceeds
        are nevertheless includable in the insureds gross estate if they are receivable
        for the benefit of the insureds estate . Even though the insured retains no
        incidents of ownership in the policy , the proceeds may be includable in the
        insureds estate if the insured has transferred the policy within three years
        before the insureds death . -LSB- 1 -RSB- . Comm . v. Est. of Noel , 380 U.S.

        Morton v. U.S. , 29 AFTR 2d 72-1531 -LRB- 4th Cir . 1972 -RRB- . Can an insured
        remove existing life insurance from his or her gross estate by an absolute
        assignment of the policy ? Yes , assuming the insured lives for at least three
        years after the assignment , the insured assigns all incidents of ownership
        , and the assignee is not legally obligated to use the proceeds for the benefit
        of the insureds estate . -LSB- 1 -RSB- If the form of the assignment reserves
        any incidents of ownership to the insured , the proceeds may be included in
        the insureds gross estate despite the insureds clear intention to transfer
        all ownership rights . -LSB- 2 -RSB- It has been held that where the insured
        had paid no premiums and had never treated the policy as his or her own ,
        the insureds irrevocable designation of beneficiaries and mode of payment
        of proceeds was an effective assignment of all of the insureds incidents of
        ownership in the policy . -LSB- 3 -RSB- The amount of any premiums paid on
        the assigned policy by the insured may be included to the extent they are
        paid within three years of death . A reversionary interest in a policy is
        an incident of ownership if , immediately before the insureds death , the
        value of the reversionary interest is worth more than five percent of the
        value of the policy . -LSB- 4 -RSB- The insured will have no such reversionary
        interest , however , if the policy is purchased and owned by another person
        , or if the policy is absolutely assigned to another person by the insured
        . Regulations state that the term reversionary interest does not include the
        possibility that a person might receive a policy or its proceeds by inheritance
        from another persons estate , by exercising a surviving spouses statutory
        right of election , or under some similar right . They also state that , in
        valuing a reversionary interest , interests held by others that would affect
        the value must be taken into consideration . For example , a decedent would
        not have a reversionary interest in a policy worth more than five percent
        of the policys value , if , immediately before the decedents death , some
        other person had the unrestricted power to obtain the cash surrender value
        of the policy ; the value of the reversionary interest would be zero . -LSB-
        5 -RSB- An insured was treated as holding a reversionary interest in a policy
        held in a trusteed buy-sell arrangement where the insured was considered to
        have transferred the policy to the trust and retained the right to purchase
        the policy for its cash surrender value upon termination of the buy-sell agreement
        . -LSB- 6 -RSB- However , a policy held in a trusteed buy-sell arrangement
        would not be includable in an insureds estate under IRC Section 2042 where
        -LRB- 1 -RRB- proceeds would be received by a partners estate only in exchange
        for purchase of the partners stock , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- all incidents of ownership
        would be held by the trustee of the irrevocable life insurance trust . -LSB-

      - Kidney dialysis is a Medicare Part B service . If you have End-Stage Renal
        Disease -LRB- also known as ESRD -RRB- , Medicare will -LRB- generally -RRB-
        coverthree dialysis treatments per week . You pay 20 % of the Medicare approved
        amount , and the Part B deductible applies . This is where your Medigap Plan
        will help cover some if not all of the remaining costs . Medigap Plan F will
        pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount and the applicable
        Part B deductible . You pay $ 0 . Medigap Plan G will pay the remaining 20
        % of the Medicare approved amount after you have paid/met the applicable Part
        B deductible . You pay , at most , $ 147 -LRB- Part B deductible in 2014 -RRB-
        . Medigap Plans A , B , D , M will pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare
        approved amount after you have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible .
        However , you are also responsible for Part B Excess Charges , so you may
        end up paying more than the Part B deductible -LRB- $ 147 in 2014 -RRB- .
        Medigap Plan Cwill pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount
        and the applicable Part B deductible ; however , you pay for any Medicare
        Part B Excess Charges . Medigap Plan Hi-F will pay all Medicare approved amounts
        after you have met/paid the $ 2,140 deductible -LRB- 2014 -RRB- . Medigap
        Plan Nwill pay the remaining 20 % of the Medicare approved amount after you
        have paid/met the applicable Part B deductible -- except for a copay of up
        to $ 20 for some office visits . You are also responsible for paying Medicare
        Part B Excess Charges . In regards to Excess Charges , this is what you are
        charged above the Medicare approved amount if the doctor , provider , or supplier
        does not accept Assignment . If a provider does not accept Assignment , they
        are telling Medicare that they do not agree to accept the payment amount Medicare
        approves for the service -- this is how you can get billed for Part B Excess
        Charges .
      - There really is n't a right answer for this , there is only your answer for
        you . There are numerous software programs that you can plug into and it will
        spit out a number and you can choose to follow that program . Is it correct
        or exact ? Unfortunately the anwer is yes , no or maybe depending on the individual
        . I tend to individualize my approach to `` how much life insurance I need
        ? '' when thinking about how much coverage to get . The first or base level
        of coverage I consider is simply this `` if I did n't wake up tomorrow , how
        much money would put things at $ 0 . ? '' This is my starting point or minimum
        level of coverage I would consider . From there , I would start adding based
        on answers to questions posed like ; Does my spouse work ? Would extra money
        help in a transition to work ? How old are my children ? Do I want to have
        something for college set aside for them ? Who can do for my family what I
        can do if something breaks and I 'm not there ? What would that cost ? If
        the main person who does the childcare passes , how much would I need to help
        with that cost ? You can look at your own situation and bring different questions
        and costs to the mix too ! Then much like the purchase of lumber for a project
        you figure the amount plus 10 % extra for just in case . This may be why some
        just say 5X income or 10X income as answers . The assumption is all those
        questions would be answered and then some . The big thing is do n't let what
        ever number you come up with discourage you from getting life insurance .
        Some is always , always better than none .
      - 'This varies for each person . A lot of variables go into the calculation
        of determining how much life insurance you need , how long you need it , and
        what is an appropriate amount to actually secure . A life insurance calculator
        can help with this . A few things to get you started when calculating out
        what you need and how long you need it for are : 1 -RRB- Do you have a mortgage
        ? If so , how much is left on it and how many more years do you have to go
        until it ''s paid off ? 2 -RRB- Any final expenses you want paid off -LRB-
        e.g. burial expenses , credit card debt , medical bills -RRB- ? 3 -RRB- Education
        expenses for you or a family member you want to pay off -LRB- such as college
        tuition -RRB- 4 -RRB- Income replacement - this is a big one ! A question
        to think about here is how much income would be needed if you died today and
        how long would your family need it to maintain their current lifestyle . An
        experienced life insurance broker can help you with this and make it a much
        smoother , easier process . I hope the information is helpful - please feel
        free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions . Thanks very
        much .'
      - Medicare does not have rebates . Are you asking how much Medicare pays a psychologist
        ? Or are you asking how much your co-pay is if you go to a psychologist ?
        If you are on original Medicare you can go to a psychologist . If you have
        a Medigap plan it will pay all co-pays .
      - If for some reason , your home canot meet the normal standards of insurance
        companiesdue to their filed underwriting rules , check with your insurance
        professional to see if there is alternative coverage offered in your state
        . In CT , for example , we have an assigned risk program called the FAIR plan
        where homeowners can obtain some protection , though much more limited than
        from the standard industry .

        buy term insurance and let it go when I retire '''' - there are many many
        many reasons why you should have life insurance during your retirement years
        . For example , if you ''re receiving a retirement pension and you die , the
        pension income may stop and not continue onto your spouse -LRB- if you chose
        the pension max option over the survivorship option when you started receiving
        benefits -RRB- - this can also apply to social security income . That ''s

      - In a very general sense , Louisiana does not tax life insurance benefits if
        left to a beneficiary who is not the estate . If the beneficiary is the estate
        , or life insurance proceeds end up in the estate because there was no living
        beneficiary listed on the policy , then the money will go through probate
        and subject to taxes and fees .

        and subject to taxes and fees .
      - The cost of life insurance in Louisiana will vary according to the type of
        policy you get , your age , whether you use tobacco , and if you have any
        health problems . A small policy for which the premium is only locked in for
        a short term period can cost under $ 15/month , whereas a large policy for
        which the premium is guaranteed to stay the same for most or all of your life
        can cost hundreds of dollars a month . To find what your cost would be , you
        can start by looking for a website that offers a quote engine that quotes
        life insurance in Louisiana . Then call that agency to firm up your cost based
        on your individual details .
      - Depends on the third party contract Progressive has procured in the state
        . In Louisiana they may represent ASI and Homesite but it can vary from state
        to state . I believe Geico does the same and does not actually write their
        own homeowners insurance but just contracts the policy out to another insurance
        company .
      - 'Since Medicare covers people over the age of 65 , and those with certain
        disabilities that have received Social Security benefits for 25 months , it
        would be very rare for Medicare to cover a circumcision . It would be possible
        , if someone with Medicare had a true medical need to be circumcisized later
        in the life , but very rare , as most circumcisions are done at birth . Given
        the fact that 40 % of births in American are covered by Medicaid , a better
        question may be `` Does Medicaid cover circumcisions ? '''' That varies by
        state , as 18 states currently do not cover this procedure , primarily due
        to the fact that it is most often elective , or not necessary . the 18 states
        that do n''t cover circumcisions , along with the year they stopped : Colorado
        2011 South Carolina 2011 Louisiana 2005 Idaho 2005 Minnesota 2005 Maine 2004
        Montana 2003 Utah 2003 Florida 2003 Missouri 2002 Arizona 2002 North Carolina
        2002 California before 1999 North Dakota before 1999 Oregon before 1999 Mississippi
        before 1999 Nevada before 1999 Washington before 1999'
      - Medicare Region C includes the states Alabama , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida
        , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , New Mexico , North Carolina , Oklahoma
        , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , West Virginia , Puerto Rico
        and the US Virgin Islands . This and other regions are designated for the
        purpose of supplying Durable Medical Equipment -LRB- DME -RRB- for Medicare
        .
      - Definitely depends on the state . Here are the Top 5 southern states average
        home insurance premiums Texas $ 1,560 Louisiana $ 1,546 Florida $ 1,544 Oklahoma
        $ 1,246 Mississippi $ 1,217 I believe as of this writing Florida has taken
        over as the highest average premium in the United States .
      - there are several sources who track this each year . and because most of them
        use their own set of criteria for evaluating these rates , the results are
        over the place ! And year to year , the rankings jump around as much as college
        basketball polls . but overall , the most expensive state is usually listed
        as Michigan or Louisiana . The difference between the two usually being whether
        or not they count Michigan 's state mandated MCCA fee -LRB- $ 186 per year
        , per vehicle -RRB- as part of the auto insurance premium or not .
      - 'Only minimal protection exists for annuity contracts under federal bankruptcy
        laws . Beyond that , the answer will vary by State . Usually annuities have
        some heightened protection level due to being considered essential for the
        debtor ''s family to maintain a minimum level of well-being and avoid becoming
        a burden to the State . If an annuity is an IRA , Roth IRA or similar retirement
        vehicle , it can receive even more protection . Here ''s a list of states
        that offer 100 % exemption of cash values from variable annuities for creditor
        claims : Arizona , Florida , Hawaii , Maryland , Michigan , New Mexico , Oklahoma
        and Texas . Kansas offers 100 % exemption after holding the product for one
        year and Louisiana after nine months . As always , consult a legal representative
        to see your specific rights in your state .'
      - 'The most expensive car insurance rates are typically found in Louisiana ,
        New Jersey , New York , Nevada , Florida , and Michigan . Prices are typically
        high in these states for a combination of factors that include high cost of
        vehicle repairs , larger number of uninsured drivers , larger percentage of
        younger drivers , and more accidents per resident . Other factors can impact
        auto insurance prices including the incidence of natural disasters in that
        state , along with the type of weather . For instance , many Northeastern
        states have been battered with higher-than-expected snowfall totals , which
        has caused a spike in the number of reported accidents . As demographics of
        states change , including the percentage of younger/older drivers on the road
        , prices can also change . Other states that often have higher-than-average
        auto insurance prices include Delaware , Alaska , Maryland , Texas , and Connecticut
        . States that often feature some of the cheapest rates include Iowa , Idaho
        , Wisconsin , North Dakota , Maine , Ohio , and South Dakota . IMPORTANT NOTE
        : This question was answered by Ed Harris , one of the premier car insurance
        brokers in the US , with more than 34 years of experience helping consumers
        find the best auto insurance options . One of his top-rated websites is Carinsurancezoom.org

      - You have to remember what life insurance gives to you upon death of a covered
        person , a TAX-FREE death benefit . There are a few circumstances which life
        insurance premiums can be `` written off '' however you need to be aware that
        the death benefit , usually a tax-free benefit will become taxable . Consider
        what that will do to your tax bill and the liability you might have . Otherwise
        I would recommend talking to your tax adviser about deducting your life insurance
        premiums .
      - There is no income tax paid on life insurance benefits , in most cases . Life
        insurance does not go through probate if the beneficiary of the life insurance
        policy is a person . If the estate is large enough , estate taxes must be
        paid on life insurance . So in that respect , the IRS can take life insurance
        money , through applicable taxes . If you are asking if the IRS can take the
        proceeds of a life insurance policy if the insured person passes while owing
        back pay to the IRS , if the beneficiary is a person , the IRS can not take
        the life insurance money from the beneficiary . An exception would be if the
        beneficiary filed jointly with the insured , or if the beneficiary owed his/her
        own money to the IRS .
      - In Canada , immediate and deferred annuities are , with one exception , taxed
        on an accrual basis . The growth or income is taxed as earned , not as received
        . How the income is taxed , depends , if it is interest income or , in the
        case of Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIFs -RRB- , interest , dividends
        or capital gains . Prescribed Annuities enjoy special taxation -LRB- Section
        304 of Income Tax Act -RRB- . They are taxed on a straight line basis rather
        than on an accrual basis . If you qualify for a prescribed annuity then total
        amount of `` expected '' interest is averaged based on the number of payments
        . For example invest in a prescribed life income annuity and your `` life
        expectancy '' is 22 years . The amount of investment DIVIDED BY `` life expectancy
        '' EQUALS return of your principle and it is not taxed . The annuity payment
        SUBTRACT the return of your principle is taxable . The tax savings can be
        substantial , which is why prescribed annuities are often used to increase
        after tax income . Especially for those who prefer guaranteed interest income
        . A life insurance policy can replace the capital for your estate . Depending
        on the the individual circumstances , increases of after tax income can be
        50 % or more . Implementing a strategy involving payout annuities is sometimes
        complicated , it is however , always permanent . Search for Retirement / Financial
        planner in your area . Then look for an experienced life insurance broker
        with a professional designation such as a CLU or CFP . If you have further
        questions , or feel that I could be of assistance please contact me .

      - Taxed depends a lot on what exactly is going on . Death benefits are not taxed
        for income purposes -LRB- as is the case with the majority of policies in
        all states -RRB- . And New Hampshire has no estate tax . Distributions from
        a life insurance policy that are not a return of basis are recognized as income
        , but since New Hampshire does not have an income tax , there would be no
        income tax due on those distributions .
      - Life insurance proceeds rarely incur any form of income tax . The proceeds
        can be taxed for estate and inheritance tax purposes . Life insurance proceeds
        are included in the gross estate calculations for all deceased individuals
        . Any gross estates that have a total value exceeding $ 5.25 million can be
        subject to US Federal Estate Tax . Additionally , some states impose either
        an estate tax or inheritance tax -LRB- or in some rare cases both -RRB- .
        These taxes have their own specific rules about the total amount and what
        might be taxable . You should consult additional resources concerning state
        specific estate and/or inheritance taxes for more information about how life
        insurance proceeds might be taxed in your state .
      - Life insurance in Massachusetts is exempt from income tax in most situations
        . If the death benefit is paid to the beneficiary in installments , the interest
        earned is subject to income tax . If the death benefit has interest earnings
        in addition to the face amount , the interest may be taxed . And if the face
        amount is cashed in before death , there are some tax implications for the
        policy owner . Aside from that , however , life insurance is not charged income
        tax as long as the beneficiary is a person , trust , or other entity.To avoid
        paying income tax , do not make the beneficiary the estate .
      - Yes , there are group disability plans that an employer will pay the premiums
        as an employee benefit . The upside is the employees are receiving a free
        benefit as a perk of working for the company . The down side of group disability
        plans are they are tax deductible for the employer , therefore if the employee
        draws benefits these are subject to income tax . If you purchase your own
        disability insurance plan with after tax premiums your benefits are tax free
        .
      - Sometimes a person is so `` set '' financially that the NEED for life insurance
        is minimal . However , many wealthy people purchase life insurance because
        they WANT it . No one knows the future , and life insurance is a way of ensuring
        that families that are used to a certain standard of living , will not be
        destitute if the breadwinner passes away after a costly illness or disability
        . Life insurance is a tax friendly , personal , and comparatively hassle free
        way of passing an estate to heirs , paying estate taxes , or providing for
        final expense needs . Indexed Universal Life is a method of distributing wealth
        into tax free or tax deferred retirement income , while still providing a
        death benefit . So , while some people `` need '' life insurance less than
        others , statistics show that those persons actually buy it more often than
        others due to the other financial benefits of having life insurance .
      - 'I assume that the question is : `` Can I take the premiums I pay for long-term
        care insurance -LRB- LTCi -RRB- and deduct all or part from my income tax
        return ? '''' The answer to that question is `` Possibly '''' . The IRS permits
        a non-business owner to applya portion of the premium paid for LTCi to the
        medical expenses section of Section A. There ''s a cap on how much one can
        apply to `` medical expenses '''' in this part of Schedule A . It goes up
        every year . Here ''s the current table for 2013 : If you are 40 , or younger
        , you can apply $ 360 of your premium to `` medical expenses '''' . More than
        40 , but no more than 50 , $ 680 More than 50 , butno more than 60 , $ 1360
        More than 60 , but no more than 70 , $ 3640 More than 70 , $ 4550 The maximum
        one used to be able to totally deduct for `` medical expenses '''' on Schedule
        A had to exceed 7.5 % of adjusted gross income -LRB- AGI -RRB- . I believe
        that is now 10 % of AGI , or soon will be . One can check for this information
        at WEBSITELINK . If addingthe maximum allowable LTCi premium amount from the
        table above to the `` medical expenses '''' of Schedule A does not push your
        total expensesover 10 % AGI , no deduction is allowable . But , if it does
        , you can only deduct that amount that exceeds 10 % of AGI . If you are a
        business owner , there are severaloptions for deducting LTCi premiumsother
        than using the Schedule A formulas and threshold . Most tax preparation software
        and certainly professional tax advisors will show how one might deduct LTCi
        premium payments , depending on how the business is set up -LRB- sole proprietorship
        , S-corp , C-corp -RRB- for tax purposes . Under current tax code , C-corps
        have the most generous allowances for deducting the payment of LTCi premiums
        by the company . Legislation for 100 % deduction of LTCi premium payment was
        in committee in Congress at the time of the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001
        . That event put virtually all increasedallowances and tax incentives for
        private purchase of LTCi on hold . No legislation is currently pending to
        change the in force formula shown above . It will increase in 2014 and forward
        for as long as Congress allows . At this writing , a special commission on
        the federal government ''s involvement in supporting the height costs of long-term
        care for the elderly is being debated and testimony is being received from
        elder-care professionals . So far , little has been discussed about the role
        of privately owned LTCi as part of a solution for the coming crisis of those
        in the baby-boomer generation `` taking too long to die '''' . No part of
        this answer is intended to be tax advice . Consult with a qualified tax professional
        before making any decisions regarding the purchase of financial instruments
        or insurance policies and the tax treatment thereof .'

      - The purpose of disability insurance is to provide income if you are unable
        to continue your work for an extended period of time due to an illness or
        and injury . In disability insurance , there are 3 types of definitions that
        a policy can use - the definition of disability in the policy is the MOST
        CRITICAL item to look at in your coverage . As to which policy features which
        definition , you need to look at which carrier you 're using and what definition
        options their policies offer . The 3 definitions of disability that a policy
        can use are true own occupation , modified own occupation , and gainful occupation
        . True Own Occupation -LRB- commonly referred to as `` own-occ '' -RRB- is
        the most favorable definition you can have on your policy . This definition
        says that you are considered totally disabled if , solely due to injury or
        sickness , you are not able to perform the material and substantial duties
        of your occupation , even if you are at work in another occupation . Modified
        Own Occupation has become the most common definition that most disability
        policies offer today . The first part of the modified definition is similar
        to the True Own Occupation definition , however , the second part of the modified
        definition is where the major change comes into play . The definition says
        that you are considered totally disabled if , solely due to injury or sickness
        , you are not able to perform the material and substantial duties of your
        occupation , and are NOT engaged in any other occupation . Gainful Occupation
        is a definition that is more commonly seen in group disability plans or plans
        offered by property and casualty companies that offer disability coverage
        . This definition provides the least coverage out of every disability plan
        . If you have a disability plan with this definition , you may want to look
        at securing coverage with a modified or true own occupation definition - or
        at the very least supplement the coverage . Many people who are looking for
        the cheapest disability plan will often end up with this definition on their
        policy Disability insurance is a very complex type of insurance with many
        moving parts and quotes depend on a variety of factors . You can not simply
        shop for a disability policy as you would for a term life insurance policy
        . For this type of coverage , you want to work with agents that have in-depth
        knowledge of products , how disability insurance works , and experience with
        these programs to help you through the process from start to finish . Please
        let me know if you have any other questions . Thanks !
      - What is the amount for a modified endowment contract for the 2014 tax year
        ? Unfortunately , you are mixing your investment or plan up . There is no
        annual guideline for a Modified Endowment Contract . You are thinking of qualified
        money contributions and confusing the two . Determination of a modified contract
        is something that can occur at any time if the extra monies applied to a policy
        trigger a formula known as the 7 pay test . When extra money is suggested
        to be added to a policy , the insurance company performs the 7 pay test on
        those funds and determines if the addition of those funds will trigger a MEC
        , before the funds are applied . More often than not , a deposit of extra
        funds triggers a MEC at some future date . If that 's the case , the policy
        does not become aMEC until that date . So money could sit and grow for several
        years , even decades without becoming a MEC . As the policy draws closer to
        the MEC date , simply taking money out of the policy can eliminate the MEC
        . There are several other ways to eliminate the MEC classification as well
        .
      - Modified Whole Life Insurance is really a company specific question . For
        one of the companies I work with , Modified Whole Life is designed for someone
        who has a medical history which most companies would decline or highly rate
        because of the medical history . Modified Whole Life from my experience is
        a policy which if you were to pass away in the first 2 years , your beneficiaries
        would only get the premium back with some interest . Oh ya , you are also
        restricted in how much Life Insurance you can get as well . These are not
        guaranteed issue policies however they are close .
      - In some business scenarios , where the company is the owner and beneficiary
        of the policy , the death benefit proceeds could be subject to the alternative
        minimum tax as well as ordinary income tax . With married couples , the death
        benefit proceeds could be subject to estate taxation upon the second death
        . But in general death benefit proceeds go tax free to the beneficiaries .
        Cash values in a life insurance policy , while the insured is alive , could
        be taxable if the life insurance policy was classified as a modified endowment
        contract and was annuitized or policy loans of gain were taken . The gain
        in a non-modified endowment policy could also be taxed at ordinary income
        tax rates , if the policy lapsed with accumulated gain in the contract , receipt
        of any policy loans and any internal policy loans that exceed basis . However
        , if a non-modified endowment policy is kept in force for the life if the
        insured policy loans of gain and withdrawals of basis could be tax free .
        But always consult your tax and legal advisers before moving forward with
        any purchase of a life insurance policy .
      - 'I always say yes because it ''s a very important type of coverage to have
        that many do n''t think about . The way I look at disability insurance is
        it protects one of your greatest assets - your ability to work . If you ca
        n''t work because of an injury or illness , how do you provide income for
        you and your family . The answer ? Your disability insurance . When you ''re
        buying a disability policy , the MOST important factor in the coverage is
        the DEFINITION OF DISABILITY . Each policy will use 1 of the 3 definitions
        : 1 -RRB- True Own Occupation - this says you are considered totally disabled
        if , solely due to injury or sickness , you are not able to perform the material
        and substantial duties of your occupation , even if you are at work in another
        occupation . In short , this is the MOST favorable definition you can have
        . 2 -RRB- Modified Own Occupation - this says that you are considered totally
        disabled if , solely due to injury or sickness , you are not able to perform
        the material and substantial duties of your occupation . This one is commonly
        seen in many individual disability insurance policies . 3 -RRB- Gainful Occupation
        - this says if you are unable to perform the duties of your occupation or
        any occupation for which you are qualified for by education , training , or
        experience due to sickness or injury . In short , this is the worst definition
        as you must meet more requirements than a true own occupation or modified
        own occupation to receive a benefit payout . This one is commonly seen in
        group disability insurance policies through an employer and property and casualty
        insurers that offer disability coverage . If you have disability insurance
        with the gainful occupation definition , I would suggest replacing it immediately
        with a true own occupation or modified own occupation policy or at the very
        least supplement it with a policy that features a stronger definition -LRB-
        I would highly recommend one with the true own occupation definition -RRB-
        . If you ''re going to buy/have disability insurance , it ''s not something
        you want to be cheap about . There are many moving parts to disability insurance
        and is not something I would suggest trying to buy on your own . This is a
        type of coverage you should consult with an experienced independent disability
        insurance broker about . Factors such as your occupation class , your income
        level , the state you live in , your medical history , your age , your desired
        benefit amount and benefit period , if you want cost of living adjustment
        riders , and other factors all impact your policy ''s structure and premiums
        . In short , they ''re very customizable , I hope the information is helpful
        - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your coverage and if
        you have any other questions . Thanks very much .'
      - That is a great question ! If you are looking at whole life insurance policies
        , you want to look at whether the policy is an `` immediate issue '' policy
        , or one that is a `` graded -LRB- or `` modified '' -RRB- '' policy . An
        immediate issue policy is one that goes into effect as soon as the underwriting
        is approved , the policy is issued , and the first payment received -LRB-
        in some States the policy may be honored if the company issued the policy
        , and the payment had not yet been received -RRB- . These policies are most
        often written for people with great health , or people with minor health issues
        , as determined by that company 's underwriters . -LRB- A good independent
        agent can help you find the best fit . -RRB- A graded or modified policy will
        be issued to folks that have more significant health issues , or by companies
        that are mass marketing the policy - like AARP or Mutual of Omaha 's `` guaranteed
        everyone qualifies '' policies that you see on TV or that arrive in your mailbox
        . These policies will all have a period of time where the desired face value
        -LRB- and typically it is very small - often not more than $ 10,000 -RRB-
        is not paid out unless the insured dies an accidental death -LRB- as strictly
        defined by the insurer -RRB- . Typically any health related passing will result
        in a payment only of the amount you 've paid into the policy , and some amount
        of interest . This period is generally 2-3 years . -LRB- Again , an independent
        agent can help sort through companies to help you find the best grade for
        you . -RRB- So an `` everyone is guaranteed '' policy like AARP offers will
        somewhere in the small print tell you that the policy has a graded or modified
        benefit period of ___ years and during that period a death resulting from
        natural causes will result in the return of premiums paid plus __ % interest
        . This is done to help limit their cost over the entirety of the risk classes
        they will be insuring . The other companies that offer this type of policy
        are doing it based upon your specific health issues , and the increased risk
        to your mortality . For example , someone who has no diabetes , or that has
        controlled their disease with a regimen like Metformin will usually be a certain
        immediate issue candidate . Someone whose diabetes went unchecked for a while
        , and is on an insulin program will more often than not be issued a graded/modified
        policy . If that unchecked diabetes has led to complications like amputations
        , diabetic coma , or neuropathy , you can usually expect the more expensive
        guaranteed issue policy to be your only option . Again , a good agent can
        help you find the best fit for you . You can expect to pay less for the immediate
        issue policy , more for the graded policy , and most for the guaranteed issue
        policy . I hope that answers all of your questions , and if not , please do
        n't hesitate to reach out and contact me , I 'd be more than happy to spend
        some time answering whatever questions or concerns that you may have . Thank
        you for asking !
      - With Modified Premium Whole Life the premium is lower in the first few years
        of the policy and increases in increments until the actual premium is reached
        . These policies are usually sold to parents for their kids , keeping the
        premium lower until the kids are old enough to take over the policy on their
        own but I have also seen them offered on TV adds by companies trying to make
        their rates look lower to generate sales . In the fine print that nobody reads
        it is disclosed that it is a Modified Premium Plan . When you buy from a good
        ethical agent , you will know exactly what you are buying .
      - Are policy loans taxable ? They very well could be . If the life insurance
        policy is a modified endowment contract , loans are taxable . If the life
        insurance is a non-modified endowment contract and the policy lapses , is
        surrendered or the policy reaches its maturity dateall policy loans , -LRB-
        those received and internal -RRB- are ordinary income tax events is the year
        they occur .
      - Life insurance income that can be taxable if the contract is a modified endowment
        contract or the life insurance cash values are annuitized . Universal life
        insurance policies issued after June 21 , 1988 with gain in the contract that
        is governed under TAMRA could cause withdrawals to be taxed during the first
        15 years of the policy . If the policy lapse before the death of the insured
        , all policy loans exceeding basis and internal policy loans are characterized
        an phantom income taxable at ordinary income rates .
      - Life insurance is , at its core , protection against loss . Term life insurance
        is `` pure '' protection , as it has no cash value . Permanent insurance combines
        pure protection with accumulation of cash value . Whole and Universal Life
        policies usually do not exceed a certain amount of cash value so that they
        keep their tax favored status . If they are overfunded , or if Indexed or
        Variable products are used , the policy may become a modified endowment contract
        and gains are subject to income tax . Some people call that type of policy
        an investment .
      - Health insurance premium credits are one form of redistribution built into
        the Affordable Care Act . Cost sharing subsidies are the other form . The
        objective is to make having health insurance more affordable for people in
        lower income brackets . Both subsidies hinge upon the family 's modified adjusted
        gross income relative to the federal poverty level . Subsidies phase in for
        families at 100 % of the federal poverty level , and phase out for families
        at 400 % and above . The government pays a portion of the health insurance
        through premium credits , based upon the family 's projected income .
      - One way to use life insurance as an investment is to fund an Indexed Universal
        Life policy with the maximum amount of premium possible without it becoming
        a MEC -LRB- modified endowment contract -RRB- . Then when you hit retirement
        age , take out loans against the cash value of the policy . For more information
        on this and other ways to use life insurance as an investment , contact an
        agency that sells IUL and other Permanent life insurance products . You can
        not use Term life insurance for investment purposes .
      - ISO is an independent organization that provides insurance companies with
        standard forms . Some companies use the ISO forms directly while others modify
        them a bit or put them into language that is easier to read . However , the
        coverages extended by the homeowners policies vary little from company to
        company . Companies will often market their unique twist on the policy ; however
        , those twists dont change things very much . Unless you have a very unusual
        house , you will find coverage the same from company to company .
      - The IRS does not tax most life insurance with income tax . If a cash value
        policy is a Modified Endowment Contract , the cash value is taxed . And if
        there is interest paid to a beneficiary because they are receiving their life
        insurance proceeds on a payment plan , the interest is taxed . Also , money
        left to the estate is taxed . But as a general rule , if money is life to
        a person as beneficiary , that person does not pay income tax on the life
        insurance received . Estate taxes do apply to life insurance , if the amount
        of the estate is above the exempted amount .
      - The advantages of life insurance can be significant if applied correctly to
        the planning need in behalf of the policy insureds beneficiaries . The tax
        advantaged features and the economic leverage of life insurance is unique
        among financial products . In addition , a TAMRA compliant non modified endowment
        policy can generate tax free distributions as long as the policy is kept in
        force for the life of the insured . The disadvantages of life insurance are
        zero . As a product , it can be misapplied , misunderstood , but not a disadvantage
        .
      - Only permanent cash value life insurance policies have cash values . Borrowing
        policy loans have interest charges associated with them from zero net cost
        loans to direct recognition loans . And keep in mind that policy loans are
        only free in a modified endowment contract that is kept in force for the life
        of the insured . Another option of accessing cash values may be withdrawing
        basis or contributions , but the force out rule governs the first 15 years
        of a permanent life insurance policy and may be subject to a taxable event
        . Before moving forward with any of these ideas consult your tax adviser .
      - It covers everything on the car , but if you do n't let the insurance company
        know that you have modified the car in some way then you may just get the
        `` stock '' rims / hubcaps or whatever if you sustain a loss . It does vary
        so I 'd check with your company , but I 'd recommend insuring those modification
        separately in the `` modifications to the car '' section of the policy and
        pay the additional premium associated with it . If you do n't , you may be
        out of luck .
      - A fully paid up life insurance policy is simply the full amount of the . policy
        paid up contrary to monthly payments through the years of policy . If someone
        wanted a 500,000 policy and calculating the rates which rely on age and rating
        , the pay a one time payment maybe 150,000 , but , again depending on age
        , and rating . No more premiums are payed . For this I specialize in modified
        endowment policies but not exactly the average endowments . The policy is
        a secure policy aimed to preserve wealth and save on taxes .

      - 'Universal life , like any financial product should be proved suitable for
        the potential client . There are several reasons why universal life -LRB-
        UL -RRB- insurance could be right for you . To make sure , you need to create
        a financial profile that establishes your risk tolerance and confirms your
        economic goals . Universal life insurance has four policy types : guaranteed
        UL for indemnification and three current assumption ULs for income based on
        crediting options like interest rates , indices and separate subaccount using
        equities and bonds investments .'
      - Universal Life is an excellent option provided it is properly funded . Because
        of the nature of the products flexible premium feature , a Universal Life
        Policy can be sold at a premium not designed to keep the policy in force for
        the persons lifetime without having to increase the amount of money a person
        needs to put in to keep the policy in force .
      - I think that Universal Life Insurance is a good idea for those who want permanent
        coverage , but do n't care whether or not their policy has much cash value
        . You can buy guaranteed no lapse UL policies at very competitive prices that
        are like that . Indexed Universal Life can be a good choice for younger ,
        healthy persons wanting to use their life insurance policy as a type of investment
        . IUL uses the stock market to generate what could be higher than normal cash
        value . But it can not go below zero gains , so if safer than playing the
        market . Finally , getting Universal Life at an older age , when the premiums
        are comparative to Term , is a good idea . UL gives you more flexibility so
        that you can decrease the face amount , increase or decrease the premium ,
        and increase or decrease the duration of the policy very easily .
      - 'Video Transcript : What is group life insurance ? In many businesses , some
        of the employer benefit packages include universal life , and that ''s in
        a group scenario . It ''s going to look ... generally , that ''s going to
        be priced at simplified issues , sometimes even guaranteed issue . The cool
        thing about universal life as a permanent form of life insurance , it can
        accumulate cash value and you could use it as a supplemental retirement plan
        or use if for its coverage benefit . When you ''re looking at group , instead
        of just term insurance which is traditionally group cases , many people are
        now looking at permanent forms of life insurance , this one being universal
        life , as part of a group benefit package . When you look at this , this is
        a pretty good idea because you ''re going to have to pay up a little bit of
        economic tax on this , about $ 50,000 of death benefit , because you ''re
        really gaining a benefit . To me , that ''s pretty worth it because wherever
        you have to pay a little bit in taxation for the benefit , you ''re not really
        putting this out on your hand . Depending upon if your employer is paying
        it or depending upon if you ''re paying it , it really is still a pretty good
        idea . You have permanent coverage based on all these lives on a group case
        and you have a little bit of cash value accumulating in this . It ''s great
        for supplemental retirement income . You can look at universal life as a double-edge
        ; a way of protecting assets , protecting your life , as well as having some
        income later on .'
      - Universal Life Insurance is not a bad idea , unless it is not a suitable product
        for your need . Universal Life can be a good solution for those who want permanent
        coverage with low cash value and at the lowest possible price . Because it
        is flexible , Universal Life is also a good `` lifetime '' plan that can be
        adjusted to suit each stage of life . Universal Life policies of the past
        we sold with projections of unsustainable interest rates , and caused many
        people a lot of grief when they lapsed far before anticipated . So it is important
        to purchase UL with your eyes wide open , and having guarantees down in writing
        .
      - Every insurance plan available in the market serves a purpose so you ca n't
        really say one is `` bad , '' each type of plan just has to be used in the
        right way . Certain programs are designed to meet certain needs . You 're
        not going to find one plan that meets every possible need you can think of
        . Universal life and whole life are two types of permanent life insurance
        - universal life has a lot of advantages to it that you wont find in whole
        life . One of the major parts of permanent programs to remember is cash value
        . However , many individuals do not realize that when the insured dies , the
        carrier takes back the cash value and pays out the death benefit . Whole life
        is generally going to be much more expensive than Universal life because of
        the guarantees inside the policy . Whole life can be a great tool for retirement
        planning , providing coverage for new borns , and other financial planning
        when you 're buying in your younger years , but can be very expensive in your
        older years . Universal life does not provide the same levels of guarantees
        inside the policy with regards to the cash value . The trade-off is the ability
        to secure lower premiums for the same amount of coverage and create flexible
        premiums . Whole life has been around for decades and decades . When universal
        life was first introduced into the marketplace -LRB- I believe around the
        1970s -RRB- , if the cash value dropped to $ 0 , your policy would crash and
        not provide you with coverage unless you paid more into it . Around the late
        90s/early 2000s , carriers started introducing what 's called a `` no-lapse
        UL rider . '' In short , these riders said that if the cash value goes to
        $ 0 , but you keep paying your premiums , the policy will still provide the
        death benefit coverage . The majority of universal life policies today will
        have this rider , now commonly known as Guaranteed Universal Life -LRB- GUL
        -RRB- , and can be structured to keep the premiums and death benefits fixed
        and guaranteed for life or up to a specified age -LRB- e.g. to age 90 , to
        age 95 , to age 100 , etc. -RRB- . The idea being to maximize your death benefit
        without overpaying premiums . Contact an independent insurance agent/broker
        to learn more about these two products and which will be more suitable to
        your needs . If you 're buying strictly for the death benefit , you will likely
        want to look into a GUL policy .
      - Medical care has a price . In the open market it is fixed by consumers who
        want a service and medical personnel who can deliver the service . The problem
        occurs when someone needs the treatment but can not or will not pay the price
        for the service . I say , Will not because every decision about spending is
        discretionary . Should society as a whole bear the responsibility for the
        medical care for every resident ? Should the nature of that care be regulated
        ? Should the source of funding be general ? Those are the most pressing questions
        when considering a universal health care system . Ultimately in a universal
        health care system there is a specified list of services and a funding mechanism
        that is not based upon need for medical services . You may need a procedure
        that isnt covered in the program . At the same time you might consider another
        procedure immoral or frivolous . Who is going to decide ? The idea of universal
        health care sounds very good until you understand that some medical services
        will probably not be covered . In the USSR dental hygiene consisted of inserting
        a fluorescent tube into the patients mouth and surgery was routinely conducted
        in a super-cold environment because anesthesia was not readily available .
        In that case , most Americans would consider the health care to be inadequate
        . However , it was available to all and at little or no direct cost to the
        consumer . Under most regimes universal health care becomes rationed health
        care . The best example is the army under war time conditions . It is called
        triage but it means that you treat those with the greatest likelihood of recovery
        before treating soldiers with graver injuries . While it might be the best
        utilization of manpower , the soldier with his leg blown off , might not like
        the wait and a narcotic shot is not going to make his family happy . The issue
        of who is going to pay for the universal health care system is the most sensitive
        . No one wants to see others in need . By the same token no one wants to pay
        the high bill for medical treatment . If the universal care is funded by general
        funds from taxes it will always be a political football . If it is paid by
        premiums paid by individuals there will always be a need to assist those unable
        to pay the premium . The problem really boils down to our expectations of
        treatment level , the availability and cost of that treatment and who is going
        to pay the price . Yes , it sounds like a great idea but it has many difficulties
        and when it is expected then the society will start to question the need for
        universal flat screen TVs , micro-wave ovens and wall-to-wall carpets . There
        really isnt an end unless you look at the Soviet Union and see how it ended
        .
      - First you need to understand that there are a number of variations on Permanent
        or Whole Life Insurance . Universal , Indexed Universal , Variable Universal
        , and straight Whole Life are all `` Permanent Life '' insurance . That said
        , I would answer your question by saying that Whole Life Insurance is Always
        a good idea ! From there it needs to be determined what you range of objectives
        are to determine which type will be best for you . As mentioned above Whole
        Life is Cash Value insurance that grows cash value tax free at a minimum guaranteed
        rate . The exceptions are the variable and universal varieties , which are
        subject to stock market variations and cost increases .
      - Is universal health insurance a good idea ? Well yes and no . In some countries
        it works very well , others not so much . Some of this could be that usually
        in countries that are universal health countries some access to health care
        services are limited , some drugs are n't available because of profit margin
        limits . I think the happiness depends on the culture of the population .
        The hard thing I see for America adopting Universal Healthcare would be the
        idea of limited or delayed services as we as a culture , only wait for cell
        phones and movie premieres . Certainly there is more to it , but that is for
        another day as the answer is n't easy and would take pages of text to cover
        .
      - 'Whole Life and Universal Life are the two main types of permanent insurance
        coverage -LRB- there are sub-categories with in that - e.g. guaranteed universal
        life , current assumption universal life , indexed universal life , participating
        whole life , non-participating whole life , and others -RRB- . Permanent life
        insurance , in general , is designed to provide coverage for the rest of the
        insured ''s life and build cash value . Universal life insurance features
        a flexible premium structure It ''s , in short , a blend between term life
        insurance and whole life insurance . A universal life policy will guarantee
        the maximum death benefit for the lowest possible premium -LRB- making it
        much less expensive than a whole life policy with the same death benefit -RRB-
        . Like with whole life insurance , universal life will build cash value ,
        although it will generally not accumulate as much cash value over the life
        of the policy as a comparable whole life policy it is essentially term insurance
        to age 121 , with the emphasis on a larger death benefit instead of greater
        cash value for the premium that you are paying . Universal life is ideal for
        anyone who wants to maximize the death benefit and is n''t worried about building
        cash value . You can guarantee benefits up to age 121 -LRB- with most companies
        -RRB- - these policies can be structured to dial down the death benefit to
        a specific age as well -LRB- e.g. to age 90 , 95 , 100 , 105 , etc. -RRB-
        , which can reduce your premium by a good margin . Whole life insurance is
        a great vehicle for planning for the future . The premiums and death benefit
        remain fixed and guaranteed for life while the policy can build cash value
        at a great rate - this structure is known as a non-participating whole life
        policy . The other type is called participating whole life policy . Participating
        WL policies can pay out dividends which can be used in several ways : 1 -RRB-
        Decrease the premium - the premium would eventually hit $ 0 at some point
        and the policy would , in essence , be self-sustaining meaning the dividend
        is equal to or greater than the premium for the program -LRB- if greater ,
        the difference can be used to increase the cash value or increase the death
        benefit -RRB- 2 -RRB- Purchasing paid-up additions - these additions increase
        the face amount of the policy 3 -RRB- Increase the cash value at a faster
        rate While whole life has many advantages , it is also the most expensive
        form of life insurance . Whole life features level premiums and death benefits
        and builds cash value at a faster rate than Universal life policies - the
        trade off between is that to increase the cash value faster , the premiums
        will be substantially higher -LRB- can often be 2-3x the premiums of guaranteed
        universal life policies on many occasions -RRB- . Please note , regardless
        of the permanent coverage type , the carrier takes back the cash value upon
        the death of the insured , and pays out the death benefit proceeds . Therefore
        , guaranteed Universal life policies allow you to maximize your death benefit
        and minimize your premium dollars that you pay for the coverage . I hope the
        information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with
        your life insurance coverage needs , including quotes and policy comparisons
        , and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .'
      - 'With a few tactical answers to a data collector , recommendations can be
        made . First what is your planning goal ? Is it an indemnification , income
        and inheritance scenario ? How long do you need to cover your financial scenario
        ? What is your medical condition , including smoking status ? Term life insurance
        provides temporary coverage for a temporary financial liability to indemnify
        your beneficiaries from economic loss at your demise . If that financial liability
        is ongoing beyond 30 years , youll need a permanent life insurance policy
        like guaranteed universal life or whole life insurance . If your financial
        goal is income , you should review participating whole life or current assumption
        universal life . Current assumption universal life has three crediting methods
        : interest rate , domestic/foreign indices or equity/bond subaccount . If
        your financial goal is to make a difference in your children , grandchildren
        , favorite charity or pay estate taxes , then survivorship policies for married
        couples and single policies for singles using guaranteed universal life or
        whole life insurance .'
      - A good life insurance agent has some important characteristics . A good agent
        is a good listener . A good agent will listen to you and will check with you
        to make sure that you are fully understood . A good agent communicates clearly
        to both you and to the insurance company . The agent should explain as completely
        as possible the details of the policy and patiently answer your questions
        . The good agent will communicate your information and concerns to the underwriting
        staff of the insurance company . Underwriters are usually quite conservative
        . The more that the agent can paint a picture that the underwriter can understand
        ; it is more likely that you will have a good outcome . Finally a good agent
        offers sound financial advice . A good agent isnt an order taker . A good
        agent will show you the advantages of alternate approaches to your problem
        . A good agent will not leave out anything vital to the case and will carefully
        counsel you as it regards your unique situation . Are there many good life
        insurance agents ? I think that there are , however , they are often in demand
        and do little to solicit business . You probably need to check with your colleagues
        and friends and locate that good life insurance agent that they trust .
      - Universal Life Insurance with a no lapse guarantee has some of the lowest
        premiums in permanent coverage . That is partly because you can buy UL that
        has almost no cash value . Therefore , most of your premium is going to purchase
        death protection . On the other hand , Universal Life Insurance can be used
        to create a lot of cash value , so that it can be used for expenses or retirement
        income . This is especially true with Indexed Universal Life or Variable Universal
        Life . Obviously , this premium will be much higher . Your age , health ,
        and policy features all also come into play in calculating the cost of Universal
        Life Insurance . This is definitely one of those products you do n't want
        to purchase without some professional guidance . It is impossible to even
        compare two UL policies unless you understand what you are comparing .
      - 'Universal life insurance can be variable or fixed . They are simply two different
        types of Universal Life . Here are the basic definitions : Variable Universal
        Life -LRB- VUL -RRB- is a form of life insurance that can build cash value
        . The cash value can be invested in separate accounts -LRB- similar to mutual
        funds -RRB- and the owner of the policy gets to choose which separate accounts
        are chosen , within the scope of what that particular product offerings are
        . The word `` variable '''' refers to the fact the owner can invest in accounts
        that vary in value such as stocks and bonds . This variable component results
        in the cash value in your VUL increasing above or decreasing below what you
        put in . Universal Life -LRB- UL -RRB- is a form of permanent life insurance
        where the excess in premium payments are credited to the cash value of the
        policy . If the cash value is referenced against a stock index such as the
        S&P 500 , it is called an Indexed Universal Life -LRB- IUL -RRB- policy .
        An IUL does not put your money in the market but rather references the performance
        of that market over a measured period of time -LRB- such as a year -RRB- and
        credits you with interest if the referenced index has increased . Typically
        , the cash value of an IUL will not decrease as the result of that market
        declining - they would simply not credit your cash value account with interest
        for that particular year .'
      - That is a great question , and one that I am frequently asked . It 's easier
        to tell you who does n't need life insurance , than it is who does . There
        is a much smaller group who do n't . If you have a fund set aside that you
        will not need to touch during your lifetime for your funeral expenses and
        final debts , along with a funded plan to provide your equivalent yearly income
        for your survivors , you do n't need life insurance . Since the vast majority
        of Americans do n't fit that category , life insurance is probably a good
        idea . The idea behind the insurance is that you do not leave those behind
        as financially hurt by your passing as they are emotionally . I hope that
        helps , thanks for asking !
      - What do annuities invest in ? Well the easiest way to find out is to review
        the insurance company 's financial statements . This will give you a good
        idea of where they look to gain returns from . Usually insurance companies
        are risk adverse with their investment choices and tend to look for long term
        investments . This is also a reason they have attached such a long surrender
        window on annuities . The idea is to invest long term for annuities , rather
        than short term .
      - I love this question ! I have clients right now who pay more for collision
        coverage than they could ever collect on a total loss . It make no sense at
        all , it 's just what they 've always done . There 's a loose formula that
        I use in advising my clients about insuring an older vehicle . Look on KBB.com
        or Edmunds and get a rough idea of what your car is worth . Do n't use the
        `` clean retail '' . That 's completely unrealistic . Use the average trade
        or rough . It 'll be closer to the truth . Also check autotrader to get a
        range of what the cars are being listed for . Once you have a pretty good
        idea of what your car is worth , compare it to the cost of your physical damage
        coverage . If the cost of the coverage is more than 10 % of the value , you
        might consider dropping the coverage . That means that , in about 2-3 years
        , you 'd spend more than the value of the car . If you do have an accident
        , you get to make the decision on whether to repair the car or replace it
        . You 've already saved enough to do either -LRB- if you have n't spent your
        savings -RRB- . Bottom line , be aware of what your vehicles are worth and
        act accordingly . Spending money on coverage that would n't pay much does
        n't make a whole lot of sense . That 's not your agent 's place to decide
        for you , but we deal with it a lot and can make a suggestion . Find a good
        agent you can trust and go through the process . You 'll save money in the
        long run .
      - 'There are two financially oriented universes : an insurance planning universe
        , and a financial planning universe . In the former , it never makes sense
        to buy term and those that live in that universe will give you an infinite
        number of reasons why - in the long run - it is a waste of your money . If
        you buy term , you will be called a `` termite '''' . In the latter , term
        insurance - or permanent insurance - are viewed asfinancial vehicles that
        can be used to achieve a certain objective or several objectives at once ,
        through leveraging : paying `` small '''' dollars now for `` large '''' dollars
        later . It ''s called `` using the right tool for the job '''' . Neither universe
        is right or wrong , although I would imagine you know which universe I come
        from . The point is to stay fixed on how much death benefit -LRB- coverage
        or face amount -RRB- you need and for how long . The way I see it , one needs
        term when they have a high need and a low budget , and a type of permanent
        insurance policy for when they eventually die . In other words , you need
        both . I recommend buying term in the higher amount that you need early in
        life -LRB- wife , kids , education , mortgage , etc. -RRB- for the period
        of time you are most likely to need it -LRB- 20-30 years -RRB- , but at the
        same time , buy a small face amount of permanent insurance to cover final
        expenses , projecting forward a nice , long lifetime and what it will probably
        cost to put you in a box , or reduce your mass through pyric methodolgies
        and put you in an urn . Allow for other final expenses , such as possible
        debt , medical expenses not covered by insurance , and a little `` transitional
        money '''' for those you leave behind . That way , when your term runs out
        , you ''ll have only the permanent plan to pay premium on , and , if you design
        it prudently , you might find that your final expense policy no longer needs
        any premium when your term runs out . You ''ll need an experienced and knowledgeable
        agent from the appropriate universe to put this together for you so that it
        fits your budget . Final note : As has been appropriately mentioned in an
        answer above , be sure to purchase only `` fully convertible term '''' for
        the reasons cited therein .'
      - I 'll add a bit to what Jeff has said because he made a very important point
        about Universal Life , that it 's a hybrid of whole life and term . Both whole
        life and Universal Life build cash value and have a separate portion that
        's purely death benefit , but they differ greatly in how they operate internally
        . I 'll follow with explaining this difference . I 'm going to speak somewhat
        generally , so do n't kill me if a particular company 's product behaves a
        little differently . Whole Life - The internal cost of insurance is averaged
        over your life expectancy and stays the same year after year . Therefore ,
        every year , the same amount of money goes toward the cost of insurance .
        The remainder goes to the cash account which grows by the insurance company
        adding money , or dividends , to the account . These dividends are set by
        the company based on the performance of it 's investments . It can change
        every year but most companies will guarantee a certain dividend . Premiums
        are level throughout the life of the policy and , if you pay your premium
        , your policy is guaranteed to be there for you . Universal Life - The internal
        cost of insurance increases every year based on your age just like term insurance
        does . The remainder goes into a cash account that the insurance company adds
        to as interest . This interest rate is also tied to the performance of their
        investments and will change from year to year . This means that , at the beginning
        of the policy , the internal cost of insurance is the lowest it will ever
        be and will increase every year . Premiums are flexible with a minimum amount
        due to cover expenses and the cost of insurance . Remainder goes into the
        cash account . There good and bad with both . With Whole life , your premiums
