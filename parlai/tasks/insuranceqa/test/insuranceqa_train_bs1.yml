    - when buy a permanent life insurance policy when you have a long need for coverage
      say 20+ year when you want the feature a permanent offer at as early an age
      as possible take advantage of low cost and a long growth window when you want
      the low cost coverage over the long period of time when you want control of
      the policy you purchase
    - when buy permanent life insurance that be a good question some agent recommend
      buy permanent life insurance every policy some financial consultant recommend
      never buy permanent life insurance both have some valid justification but both
      be rather extreme position in real life with budget limitation , health risk
      , bear market and other consideration it be hard me recommend only 1 option
      not everyone can afford all the life insurance they need in permanent coverage
      yet buy only term present the risk of be unable qualify for a new policy when
      the current 1 expire put money in the stock market and savings plan shall cover
      final expense need eliminate the need for permanent life insurance but will
      those investment and savings be there when you die my recommendation be buy
      term insurance temporary need and permanent insurance for lifelong need specifically
      permanent insurance be good for final expense need such as funeral , burial
      pay off credit card and other cost associate with put the deceased rest permanent
      insurance be recommend if you want use the policy proceeds pay estate tax ,
      pass money to heir or bequeath money a charity if you use term insurance for
      any purpose that may find you outlive the term you may find you no longer qualify
      for a new policy all your plan for your life insurance be moot
