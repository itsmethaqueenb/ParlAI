      - Actually term life insurance can not be paid up . It just expires or has a

        whole life , universal life , indexed universal life or variable universal
        life do endow or are `` paid up '' plans in which you are asking . Sorry !
      - Term life insurance is never paid up . Assuming you make your premium payments
        , if you are still alive at the end of the term life insurance policy 's stated
        time period -LRB- e.g. - 10 years -RRB- the policy ends and the life insurance
        protection ceases . In this case the insurance company has won the bet , you
        did n't die during the period the policy was taken out for and they get to
        keep all the premium paid for taking on your risk during that time period
        . The only exception to this general rule is in the case where a Return of
        Premium rider was purchased with the term life policy . In this situation
        if you are still alive when the term life policy reaches the end of its stated
        period of coverage the policyholder is refunded the premium they have paid
        to the insurance company over the life of the policy . You do pay additional
        premium costs for this Return of Premium provision .
      - Term Life Insurance does not have the option to become paid up , like permanent
        life insurance does . If you pay your policy each monththrough to the end
        of the term , the policy simply ends or takes on a higher cost . There is
        nothing to cash in . Also , you do not have the option to pay term at an increased
        cost for a shorter time period , like you do with permanent insurance . If
        you quit paying on it at any time , the policy ends .

      - That is an excellent question ! One of two things will happen . If the policy
        was paid up long ago , and has remained in effect , then it acts like any
        other policy , and when the insured passes , it pays out . Unfortunately ,
        what happens most often is that Parents had a policy on the child , the parent
        that paid the bills passes , the policy does n't get paid , goes into grace
        period , and then lapses , and cancels . All those years of payments go up
        in smoke . Please ensure that your loved ones have a copy , or access to ,
        your finances , sand their payment schedules , so that this does n't happen
        to you . I have had to have the conversation about unpaid policies far too
        often , and each time it breaks my heart to see the child realize there is
        no insurance . Thanks for asking !
      - A life insurance policy is paid up when all required annual premiums have
        been paid . If the policy is a `` whole life paid up at age 95 '' contract
        , the policy is paid up at age 95 . It is important to note that the term
        `` paid up '' is often misused . In whole life policies that pay policy dividends
        , the dividend values are frequently used to buy `` paid up additions '' which
        are paid up , additional amounts of insurance that have cash value and add
        to the base policy . The cash value of paid up additions may be projected
        , based on the current dividend scale , to grow to a point in the future where
        those values may be used to premiums on the base policy . The policy is not
        paid up when the policy owner pays premiums this way .
      - This is a great question and I appreciate the opportunity to offer some answers
        ! Whole Life Insurance has a lot of benefits ! For one it is highly customizable
        in the way it may be funded . It can be set up to be funded in as little as
        11 annual payments , or paid for monthly over the life of the insured up to
        age 100 . Whole Life policies have a Guaranteed cash accumulation feature
        where a guaranteed interest is paid into a cash value portion of the policy
        , which then becomes a liquid asset accessible at the will of the owner of
        the policy . The interest -LRB- as well as dividends in participating policies
        -RRB- is paid into the cash value Tax-FREE . And a policy may be `` over-funded
        '' up to about 300 % , which of course will increase the tax-free interest
        growth rate . In a participating policy where dividends are paid in , the
        dividends may be used to purchase additional insurance . This increases not
        only the death benefit without ever taking another medical exam or even answering
        questions , but also increases the dividends paid ! Whole life insurance does
        not expire . It remains in force -LRB- as long as the premiums are paid up
        -RRB- until the insured dies , the owner decides to surrender the policy -LRB-
        for the cash value -RRB- , or the insured reaches the age of endowment . The
        age of endowment varies with the policy , but may be age 95 , 99 , 100 , or
        now days may be as high as age 121 . When that happens the entire value of
        the policy is handed over to the owner of the policy . Income tax free . When
        paid , the death benefit passes to the beneficiary -LRB- ies -RRB- income
        tax free . Another option available with Whole Life Insurance is the ability
        to use the cash value and then to take loans from the policy death benefit
        to supplement retirement income ! This can be set up to be paid out monthly
        , quarterly or annually ... and these payments are , again , Tax-free ! So
        to sum up , Whole Life Insurance does not expire regardless of the possible
        declining health of the insured and provides a death benefit to beneficiaries
        that is transferred tax-free . Whole Life grows Cash Value , Tax-Free , which
        is a liquid asset that may be used for any purpose the owner wishes , and
        may be accessed without incurring a taxable event by means of a policy loan
        . With participating policies the cash value can increase by means of guaranteed
        interest and dividends , which may be used to buy additional insurance with
        no medical requirements . The premiums are set at the beginning of the policy
        and are guaranteed not to increase for any reason . And the entire premium
        may be paid in as little as 11 annual payments , spread out over the lifetime
        of the insured , or set up to be paid over a 15 , 20 or 30 year period determined
        by the the owner of the policy . And Whole Life Insurance may be used to supplement
        retirement income as a tax-free cash stream .
      - 'What happens when your term life insurance ends ? What will happen is this
        : you will take out your checkbook , remember what your premium used to be
        , breathe heavy sigh , and then make your check payable for a much larger
        amount . In my career I have seen renewal premiums literally 10 times the
        original rate . Yes , 10 times . Doesnt always happen , but it does happen
        . And you will not know how high the increase will be until you get your renewal
        notice . They dont tell you in advance . Why would an insurance company slam
        you on the renewal ? Several factors could be involved . One is that they
        are a little bit concerned about their reserves . They need to bulk up . Another
        could be that they feel the credit market is a little bit tight . So they
        need to store up some money in case they cant go out and get enough new money
        . Perhaps they feel the whole block of term business is not profitable . Maybe
        there is a big fat insurance company lurking in the wings ready to buy them
        , and they consider the term business to be a liability . So they will jack
        up the rates to get rid of a lot of policies . -LRB- To tell you the truth
        , I need to learn a little bit more about this last reason myself . Most people
        keep paying term premiums , dont die , and then drop their policies anyway
        . So the insurance company has received a bunch of money without paying any
        out . Why not keep the renewal rates more reasonable to hold onto these customers
        ? -RRB- But the net result of these high renewals is that the only people
        who hold on to their policies are people who really need the coverage , and
        feel they have no other option . They feel that their medical history or lifestyle
        risks would make them ineligible for coverage , or make a new policy too expensive
        . The fact of the matter , though , is that they may indeed qualify for a
        better rate elsewhere . They should get prequalified and really see what the
        market has to offer . They may very well be surprised . And if they dont get
        a better deal , then the term conversion rider in their policy may be an option
        . As long as they are not over the maximum conversion age , they could lock
        into permanent rates . And they dont have to convert the entire face amount
        at once : it could be done in stages , to better manage cash flow . Thanks

      - 'A retirement plan really is an extension of a financial plan.There are two

      - A paid up life insurance policy is one that requires no more premiums for
        it to remain in effect . In essence , you have paid enough premiums that ,
        left untouched , your policy will stay in effect for the rest of your life
        . Some people want to quit paying premiums before the policy is paid up ,
        and choose to settle for a `` reduced '' paid up amount of insurance . The
        same thing happens , the policy will stay in effect with no further premiums
        paid . But the face amount of the policy will be less than what it was originally
        .
      - If a life insurance policy is truly `` paid up '' it simply means no further
        premiums are due and it is guaranteed to be that way . Some people use the
        term `` paid up '' incorrectly to describe premium `` offsets '' using dividend
        values to pay required premiums . Such arrangements are not paid up and not
        guaranteed . More on this in the last paragraph . Some whole life policies
        are designed to be paid up at a relatively early duration e.g. Policy Year
        20 , Age 65 , etc. . The premiums for these policies are relatively high as
        a result . In comparison , in most cases , whole life policies are designed
        to have required premiums to age 95 or 100 or later . Such policies have relatively
        low premiums and are not paid up until age 95 or 100 . A policy can also be
        `` paid up '' at a lesser value than the death benefit . Whole life policies
        feature a `` reduced paid up '' non forfeiture provision . In the event the
        policy owner wishes to stop paying annual required premiums , the policy owner
        can ask the insurer to reduce the death benefit amount for the policy so that
        no further premiums would need to be paid . It is important to note that policies
        which use policy dividends and/or the cash value of Paid Up Additions to offset
        the required premiums due at some future point are not `` paid up '' . In
        a low interest environment like we have now , dividends are being reduced
        from what was illustrated . Many clients who expected to stop paying premiums
        and instead pay them via the dividend values in their policy can not do so
        yet since the dividend values are not sufficient to offset premiums .
      - 'What happens when your Term life Insurance policy `` runs out '''' or expires
        or lapses is all the same : Nothing . You no longer have any insurance coverage
        . And since Term insurance has no cash value you do n''t get any kind of refund
        or surrender value . The only exception is if you had purchased a `` Return
        of Premium '''' rider with your policy . I that case you most likely will
        receive a portion of the premiums paid in returned to you .'
      - Term Life Insurance Ends when the contract period is over . Term life Insurance
        ends when you havent paid your premium and the reinstatement period is over
        . Term life insurance ends when a death claim occurs while the policy is in
        force . Term life insurance ends and permanent life insurance begins when
        the conversion privilege is exercised on the existing term life insurance
        policy .
      - 'This is a great question that I was just answering last night with another
        client . The first and foremost thing that you should look for is an agent
        . Even though much of the world buys insurance over the phone , a local agent
        can help you determine what types of coverage you want and need and is familiar
        with the local area . Being familiar helps in determining the reconstruction
        cost vs the selling price vs the tax value . All three numbers are usually
        different . Most people do not want to be either under or over insured , and
        a local agent will help with that . The second thing to look for is the company
        writing the policy . You will never know how good your insurance is until
        you need it . When a minor claim happens typically every insurance company
        will be able and willing to pay the claim . It is when the catastrophic occurs
        that you really get what you pay for . Thousands of dollars and many hours
        can be wasted when your insurance company is unwilling to agree with you .
        This is also another reason to have local agent representation . Third and
        finally is look at what other coverages are available and discuss whether
        or not you want to buy those coverages or self insure . Some of my favorite
        must haves are : replacement cost on contents , increased construction costs
        and replacement cost on the home itself , a deductible that you can afford
        to pay tomorrow if needed , sewer back up if you live downhill of anyone ,
        A-rated carrier , and local claims personnel . There are many more topics
        that need to be discussed and reviewed which is why my # 1 recommendation
        on what to look for when buying home insurance is a great local agent .'
      - This is the amount of insurance that if you stopped making premium payments
        today and elected to take a paid up policy , you would have that amount of
        insurance for the rest of your life . A 20 pay life policy would be paid up
        in 20 years with no premium due after that time while the insurance is still
        in force . A whole life policy can have a reduced paid up option after enough
        cash value has accumulated in the policy to provide a paid up policy . This
        table can be found in your policy . A good agent can help review your policy
        with you to help you understand your non-forfiture options
      - A Term life insurance policy is one that will have the same premium for a
        set number of the years in the term . Some Term life insurance will guarantee
        that the premium will not go up for the entire term ; other Term life insurance
        will guarantee that the premium can not go up for part of the term . E.g.
        30 year Term life may be guaranteed not to go up in price for the full 30
        years , or it can be guaranteed not to go up for 20 of the 30 years and ``
        hope '' that it wo n't go up the last 10 years . Term life insurance does
        not have any cash value . If you quit paying on Term life , it will end after
        one month .
      - 'You have been operating your business for 6 years without incident which
        is great . This is the first claim -LRB- and hopefully last claim , -RRB-
        so I understand your concern about your premiums increasing next year . I
        ''m not exactly sure what your business does , but knowing what you do would
        help me to further figure out whether or not your premiums would increase
        because of this claim . When re-marketing your account with other insurance
        companies we would need to explain what happened and discuss the likelihood
        of this happening again . Insurerslook at the historical data associated with
        past claims , current trends , andalso consider estimations of future losses
        to help determinethe rates that they use.This is a great question and thereare
        several things you need to consider.When you get a moment , turn to the conditions
        section of your CGL policy . The conditions state what your duties are in
        the event of occurrence , claim , or suit . 1 . Notify company of occurrence
        a . You must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of an ``
        occurrence '''' or an offense which may result in a claim . To the extent
        possible , notice should include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- How , when and where the
        `` occurrence '''' or offense took place ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the names and addresses
        of any injured persons and witnesses : and -LRB- 3 -RRB- The nature and location
        of any injury or damage arising out of the `` occurrence '''' or offense .
        b . If a claim is made or `` suit '''' is brought against any insured , you
        must : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Immediately record the specifics of the claim or `` suit
        '''' and the date received : and -LRB- 2 -RRB- Notify us as soon as practicable
        If you read the `` Obligations at Insureds Own Cost `` condition it says :
        `` No insured will , except at the insured ''s own cost , voluntarily make
        a payment , assume any obligation , or incur any expense , other than for
        first aid , without our consent . '''' There are many questions that would
        need to be answered , but if I were you I would put my insurance carrier on
        notice that there has been an incident and let them take the reigns . Please
        contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns about this claim
        . I would be happy to help guide you in the right direction . Have a great

      - Life insurance is about paying money to beneficiaries when the insured person
        dies . Property insurance pays when something happens to your property , health
        insurance pays when something happens to your health , disability insurance
        pays when something happens to your ability to work , and life insurance pays
        if something happens to your life . However , some life insurance policies
        also have cash that can be accessed while you are alive .
      - The major advantage of Term Life Insurance is it 's low cost per thousand
        dollars of coverage . Of course , this price goes up drastically when the
        term ends , so that is only an advantage if you no longer need the policy
        after the term expires . Another advantage of Term insurance is that it usually
        does ensure that you are insurable the rest of your life . If you get a policy
        that can be converted to permanent insurance for a number of years after the
        policy was issued , you can change it to Whole or Universal Life with no health
        questions asked . The price will be high , because it is permanent insurance
        and will be issued at the older age you are when you do the conversion . But
        that still is a major advantage , if you would happen to be diagnosed with
        a serious illness and are unable to get a new policy .
      - You can contact the insurance company to request to borrow funds from the
        policy -LRB- your company 's policyholder services department should be able
        to handle it - they may request you complete a form for written documentation
        purposes -RRB- . The maximum amount you can borrow is up to the current surrender
        or loan value cited in the policy at the time you want to borrow from the
        cash value . Keep in mind , when you borrow money from the cash value , you
        are creating a loan against the policy -LRB- the funds are expected to be
        paid back and , much like you do when borrowing from a bank , an interest
        rate is being charged on the borrowed monies -RRB- . If the insured dies with
        an outstanding loan , the carrier will deduct the outstanding amount and any
        interest charges from the death benefit and give the difference to the beneficiary
        . I would recommend consulting with your agent before borrowing from the cash
        value to find out what will happen when you create a loan against the policy
        and what you 're responsible for . I hope the information is helpful - please
        feel free to contact me for help or if you have any other questions . Thanks
        very much .
      - First let me ask you if you purchased temporary Term coverage , or permanent
        , Whole Life coverage ? If it is Term , then , so long as you continue to
        pay the premium , it will last for the period you contracted for , as level
        term , and then the rates will rise considerably . 97 % of folks let their
        Term policy lapse before that ever happens . I always recommend Whole Life
        , because it last a lifetime , if you pay the premiums , and those premiums
        NEVER increase , and also it builds up cash value which you can borrow against
        , or take out tax free to pay for college , retirement , or a new home . While
        more $ at first , eventually it actually becomes less expensive than term
        , as its built up value can pay the premiums for you . A quality company can
        provide you with a variety of choices . Call me , Gary Lane , Agent , New
        York Life , 949 797 2424 . Thank you .

        is hurt while in your rented premise that you are deemed responsible for .
        Remember every policy is different . Please read your policy completely to
        understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be or contact
        your local agent to have them go over the policy with you .
      - If you apartment was on fire and all your personal belongings were gone ,
        where will you stay temporally ? Renters insurance will provide you with temporal
        hotel accommodation . If you were having a party at your apartment and one
        your guest slips and falls on your wet kitchen floor and breaks their hip
        and ambulance came took them to hospital and the medical bill is $ 28,000
        . Now who do think is responsible for that ? YOU my friend ! Let say you loaded
        you car with your personal stuff worth say $ 5000 going on vacation to Florida
        . You car overheats at point and caught on fire and both your car and its
        content are gone . Assuming you have physical damage insurance on your car
        , your car insurance company with replace the fair market value of vehicle
        minus any applicable deductible . They will not replace your vehicle content
        of $ 5000 . If you had renters insurance for your apartment , they will cover
        your personal stuff in vehicle .
      - I do not see very many disadvantages to renters insurance . Lets look at the
        coverage renters insurance provides , and then we can talk about what it does
        not cover . Renters insurance is designed to cover your personal property
        , protect you if you are sued , and pay medical bills if someone is injured
        on your property . Most people get upset when their insurance does not cover
        something . Sometimes people file claims to pay their landlord for clean up
        their deposit did not cover -LRB- this is not covered -RRB- . Some agents
        use renters insurance as an ad on coverage and they choose how much coverage
        without consulting your need . If you have renters insurance and only have
        $ 10k of coverage when you needed more you will not be paid more than the
        $ 10k A common deductible on renters insurance policies is $ 500 , and often
        smaller theft claims do not exceed the deductible . I see this a lot in personal
        items stolen out of vehicles . I think the advantages of having renters insurance
        far out way not having it . People in our society sue for a lot of different
        things , and protecting your self from being sued for Bodily Injury or Property
        Damage out side of your Auto is an essential part of creating a sound financial
        plan . Just make sure you have the proper coverage before you buy .

      - 'If your lease agreement has a clause requiring Renters Insurance , yes ,
        the Landlord may enforce the clause thereby forcing you to buy Renters Insurance
        or being in breach of the contract . Renters Insurance is a valuable coverage
        ; many renters simply deny the issue due to the small cost of coverage . In
        our many years in business , we have seen a variety of claims ; the following
        is just a short synopsis of the necessary protection . Renters Insurance includes
        Personal Property Coverage and Personal Liability Insurance . Liability Insurance
        being the more important coverage as this is where a legal action against
        the renter could cause undue hardship . If a fire or water damage claim is
        caused by the renter , the renter would be negligent and therefore liable
        for the damage caused . Although the property may be insured , the insurance
        carrier of the Landlord would subrogate and may bring legal action against
        the tenant . Personal Property coverage would provide protection against theft
        , fire and water damage to the contents of the renter . The Landlord ''s insurance
        does not cover the tenant ''s property in any way ; neither does it allow
        for legal protection of the tenant . Should a tenant not be interested in
        this valuable protection , we recommend purchasing the minimum available personal
        property coverage with the minimum liability protection of $ 100,000 . This
        coverage would cost in the range of $ 100 - $ 300 per year depending on the
        region of the country and the specific insurance carrier underwriting the
        risk . You may obtain a Renters Insurance quote online at : WEBSITELINK'
      - 'Yes , Yes & Yes !!! Although Renters Insurance is designed to protect the
        Personal Belongings of the Renter , the policy also includes Personal Liability
        Coverage . There have been endless numbers of cases in Small Claims Court
        where there are issues between Landlords and Renters following damage to rental
        units . With the presence of a Renters Insurance Policy , the insurance company
        will investigate the claim and find if in fact the renter ''s negligence caused
        the loss ; if so , the damage repairs will be covered by the tenant ''s personal
        liability section of the Renters Insurance Policy . In some States , the Renters
        Insurance Policy is a requirement under the conditions of the standard rental
        agreement ; however , it is prudent of Landlords to require Renters Insurance
        . As a rhetorical question : ` Would you wish to rent your property to a tenant
        not concerned with insuring their own belongings ? '' Renters Insurance is
        very inexpensive and contrary to common belief , you do n''t have to speak
        to a salesperson to obtain a quote and buy the insurance . In many States
        , the minimum coverage is $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 of Personal Property and the
        policy automatically comes with $ 100,000 of Personal Liability . Depending
        on your selected deductible , the premium may be as low as $ 100 per year
        . If you are responsibly cautious only about the liability issue , we would
        recommend selecting the highest deductible since this will generate the lowest
        premium ; the deductible does n''t apply to the liability section . For an

      - Renters insurance protects the landlord in the sense that it can provide extra
        liability protection A renters policy is taken out by the renter to cover
        the renters possessions . It does not cover the dwelling or items owned by
        the landlord . If however a renter is negligent and someone is injured on
        the property , the renters insurance will provide protection from lawsuit
        .
      - When you rent an apartment , you have the option to buy renters insurance
        . These policies protect your belongings while you live in the rental property
        . It is up to your whether you want to buy one of these policies . This insurance
        isnt needed to rent an apartment . There is no government law that forces
        you to buy renters insurance before you can rent an apartment . Its not like
        driving a car , which requires car insurance . If you want to rent an apartment
        without insurance , you are free to do so . It also doesnt matter to your
        landlord whether or not you have renters insurance . A renters policy doesnt
        cover damage to your apartment building or to your landlords property . Your
        landlord will protect himself with his own insurance policy . Since you dont
        cover your landlord at all with renters insurance , he wont ask you to buy
        it before renting out the apartment . While renters insurance is not a requirement
        , it is often a good idea . If your apartment is robbed or destroyed in an
        accident , you will need to replace all your belongings on your own . In addition
        , if someone gets hurt in your home , you as the renter are liable . The injured
        person could sue you and force a costly settlement . Renters insurance covers
        you in both these costly situations . When you own one of these policies ,
        you protect yourself from the financial risks of owning an apartment .
      - The difference between Renter 's Insurance , Condo Owner 's Insurance & even
        Homeowner 's lies in the insurable interest . A renter 's policy is going
        to cover personal property -LRB- contents -RRB- , but not any building coverage
        ... since the renter does not own the building , they do not typically have
        an insurable interest . However , in some cases , there have been leases that
        require the tenant to pay for the insurance and taxes - these are called triple
        net leases . The renter in these cases may have to purchase coverage for the
        building rented -LRB- usually a home -RRB- . Condos almost always have a condo
        association . The condo association covenants determine how the condo should
        be covered . Some associations only cover the exterior walls , leaving the
        condo owner to cover everything attached to the building including what 's
        between the drywall/sheetrock & exterior . Some associations cover everything
        up to the drywall/sheetrock , while others even include anything attached
        to the drywall/sheetrock including cabinets , etc. . On occasion , the condo
        association can assess a property deductible to each individual condo for
        $ 10,000 ; in which case you would want to make sure that amount is added
        to the your policy . In each case , whether renter 's insurance or condo insurance
        , make sure you obtain the lease or covenants and make sure you do n't have
        any `` holes '' in your coverage !
      - 'A Landlord can require Renters Insurance in any State as a condition of the
        Lease Agreement . Renters Insurance is an increasingly more valuable commodity
        for both home owners and renters in a very litigious society . Renters Insurance
        provides the Landlord peace of mind in the event a claim occurs as the result
        of the tenant ''s negligence ; the home owner will not be negatively impacted
        by their insurance . Many Landlords require the Tenant to list the Landlord
        as an ` Additional Insured '' on the Renters Insurance Policy this will insure
        the Landlord receives a copy of all correspondence including cancellation
        notices and renewal notices . Renters Insurance provides coverage for the
        tenant ''s Personal Property as well as offering Personal Liability coverage
        which is the specific section in the interest of the Landlord . Without this
        important coverage , legal actions are more damaging and cumbersome for all
        parties concerned . There are a few States that have required all tenants
        in the State to purchase Renters Insurance and the requirement is a compulsory
        section of the Standard Lease Agreement which is signed by both the Landlords
        and Tenants . States have taken this action due to an overwhelming load of
        small claims cases burdening the Court System . Renters Insurance is an inexpensive
        form of security which all responsible tenants should wish to have ; in many
        localities , a policy can be purchased for as little as $ 8.00 per month .
        For a Renters Insurance quote , there is an available link to obtain your
        quote and purchase the policy online : WEBSITELINK In order to produce the
        lowest rate , you will need to select the minimum amount of Personal Property
        Coverage available to cover all your possessions , select the minimum required
        Personal Liability Limit , and select the maximum available Deductible . The
        deductible does n''t apply to the Personal Liability section , so if this
        is the only reason that you are buying the policy , the maximum deductible
        should be purchased to obtain the lowest premium .'
      - As of this date and to the best of my knowledge renters insurance is not required
        in any state . A landlord may through the rental agreement require any tenant
        to carry renters insurance . Renters insurance is typically very low cost
        and can provide protection when you need it . With renters insurance you not
        only cover your personal property but also adds liability coverage in the
        event that someone is hurt while at your residence .
      - Renters Insurance in the US is an outgrowth of the regular Homeowners Insurance
        policies that have been in use in many states since the mid 20th Century .
        In fact for many companies the forms in use continue to be variations -LRB-
        with appropriate state approvals -RRB- of forms developed by the Insurance
        Service Office , ISO . The Insurance Service Office is not alone in developing
        contractual homeowners and subsequently renters policy forms in use in the
        various states . There are other product development groups and larger companies
        often develop their own product offerings . With all that said , there are
        some common elements to homeowner and renters policy and by far the use of
        annual -LRB- 12 month terms predominates -RRB- . Decades ago there were companies
        using forms that lasted as much as three years for homeowners , but the reality
        of getting appropriate approvals from the regulators , responding to loss
        results and getting mortgage companies to accept the policies has all led
        to a fairly standardized approach in the US that homeowners and renters policies
        are primarily annual contracts . But do n't throw away all your old policies
        when you get to the end of a year if you are all aware of an event that might
        give rise to coverage during that time period . For example suppose during
        the term of your renters policy your dog bit a neighbor . That occurrence
        then would be associated with the payment of loss for the infliction of bodily
        injury even though the damage is only assessed completely for years to come
        . Her is why I mention dog bites . In many states you have absolute liability
        for your dog 's aggression . And , dogs who maul a victim are often attacking
        children -LRB- easier prey to the dog -RRB- and the damages are usually to
        the child 's head . Therefore as they age there can be a need for repeated
        surgeries to address the scaring . Since the renters policy is typically an
        occurrence policy , the policy which will respond is not the current insurer
        several years out , but the insurer at the time of the event or '' occurrence
        ''
      - NO they can not force you to have renters insurance but they can choose to
        not rent to you if you do not get renters insurance . Most renters policies
        are on average $ 100 a year depending on your state that is with 40K worth
        of coverage on your contents and 100K in liability coverage . It is well worth
        the cost and in many cases if you bundle it with your auto insurance it lowers
        your auto insurance I have seen in many cases it lowered your auto insurance
        10 a month and the renters insurance is less then 10 a month so this puts
        you ahead . Contact a local independent agent and they can help you muddle
        through what works best for you
      - Rates for renters insurance depend upon a few factors . Where your apartment
        is located , how much personal property you are insuring and what liability
        rates you requested . For example , in Michigan , where I live I can get renters
        insurance covering $ 30,000 of personal property with $ 300,000 in liability
        coverage for about $ 200/year . The point is renters insurance is very affordable
        . I hope this helps .
      - Great question ! Anyone who will be putting their belongings into a home owned
        by someone else , and who does n't have the money to replace it all should
        it be stolen or destroyed needs renters insurance . It is a common mistake
        to believe that the landlords insurance covers you , but it only covers what
        they stand to lose , not you . Renters insurance is relatively inexpensive
        , and can really be a blessing if your home is damaged , or you are robbed
        . If you would like help , please feel free to contact me . Thanks for asking
        !
      - 'Always . And the landlord should request evidence of the existence of the
        renters insurance . Reason number one : Under the personal liability coverage
        of a renters policy the carrier agrees to pay the sums the insured is legally
        liable for as a result of bodily injury or property damage . What type of
        occurrencescould be involved ? A guest in the renter ''s apartment slips on
        a wet bathroom floor , falls , and is injured . This is bodily injury . The
        tenant leaves a pan of oil on the stove unattended and a fire results damaging
        the building . This is property damage . Reason number two : Unless legally
        liable , the landlord is not responsible for the tenant ''s business or personal
        property -LRB- for things like fire , theft , mysterious disappearance , etc
        -RRB- The tenant should cover their own property with insurance like a renters
        policy .'
      - A landlord at their discretion can require renters insurance as part of the
        rental agreement . If you do not wish to purchase renters insurance you have
        the right to look for housing from a landlord who does not have this requirement
        . The landlord is not breaking any laws by making renters insurance a requirement
        of the rental agreement .
      - A renters policy is essentially a homeowners policy that does not cover the
        structure . It has two basic coverages , Property Coverage which is designed
        to make you `` whole '' -LRB- within the definitions of the policy -RRB- should
        you have a `` covered loss '' and suffer economic loss in excess of the deductibleas
        a result . It also covers personal liability for bodily injury or property
        damage that the renter is liable for by law .
      - Renters insurance does indeed cover your personal property . However , there
        are many other components of a renter 's policy . For example , in the event
        of a covered claim -LRB- fire or tornado are two common ones -RRB- , your
        living expenses away from your house or apartment will be covered -LRB- subject
        to policy limits -RRB- . So , semantically , they are nearly the same , but
        there are differences in the specific benefits .
      - 'The definition of `` good '''' varies from person to person and business
        to business . However , here are some of the aspects of a health insurance
        policy I advise my clients to be aware of and comfortable with : 1 -RRB- Are
        the doctors , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use in-network providers
        with the health insurance plan you are considering ? 2 -RRB- What would your
        coverage be -LRB- if any -RRB- if you want to use a health care provider who
        is not an in-network provider with the health insurance plan you are considering
        ? 3 -RRB- What is the pharmacy benefit under the health plan you are considering
        ? And , if you have specific prescription drug needs are they covered under
        the health insurance plan ''s prescription formulary and to what extent are
        they covered -LRB- copays , co-insurance , deductible & co-insurance -RRB-
        ? 4 -RRB- Does the health insurance plan allow its members to go directly
        to specialists such as cardiologists or does it require that you are referred
        to a specialist by your primary care physician first ? 5 -RRB- If you travel
        regularly outside of your home area -LRB- to other states or outside the USA
        -RRB- does the health plan provide for coverage outside of your home service
        area in the event you need non-emergency care ? 6 -RRB- Is the health insurance
        company you are considering a well established national or regional health
        insurance carrier with strong finances or is it one of the new , experimental
        Co-Op health plans recently established under the provisions of ObamaCare
        ? 7 -RRB- Does the overall value proposition of the health insurance plan
        you are considering meet your current and anticipated needs ? In other words
        , does its monthly premium , coverage levels and provider network really work
        for you .'

      - Most insurance companies do not surcharge for animals . Instead they exclude
        certain breeds , restrict payment on others and/or decline the property completely
        . Dog bites are a major problem for insurance companies and they are more
        likely to deny coverage and exclude coverage for certain breeds should you
        purchase the animal following the start of the policy .
      - Yes it does . You have liability coverage on your Renter 's policy . It usually
        comes with $ 100,000 of coverge which would cover a dogbite . This is why
        the agent will ask you if you own adog and what kind . Many companies will
        not insure you if you own certain breeds such as Pitbulls or Rottweilers .
      - Great question . While pitbulls are great dogs for the most part insurance
        companies tend not to like to insure them . You will have a very hard time
        to get to cover you dog in your home insurance policy . Most insurance companies
        have a list of dogs they will not insure and pitbulls are on almost all of
        them .
      - 'That is going to depend on the insurance carrier . Each carrier maintains
        it ''s own list of animals that it considers to be higher risk . Some of the
        dog breeds that tend to be on many of the lists are : pitbulls , german shepards
        , anddobermans to name just a few . Contact your local agent to discuss the
        effect that certain dog breeds mayhave on your homeowners insurance coverage
        and pricing .'
      - Pitbulls are an excluded breed under many homeowners and renters policies
        . There are companies out there though that will had dog liability as a separate
        policy as long as you and the dog meet the carrier 's expectations for coverage
        . Contact a local agent to find out more about coverage availability and pricing
        within your geographic location .
      - It is possible that pitbulls may be an excluded breed under the terms and
        conditions of your policy . The best way to determine that , of course , is
        to check with your insrance professional . Some companies who limit breeds
        may also allow them provided that you can show proof of the dog successfully
        compleeting a comprehensive training program .
      - Why would you buy whole life ? Here 's why I bought it . I wanted lifetime
        coverage as I do n't think I would die in 10,20 or 30 years . I was young
        enough to purchase a fair amount of coverage because I was in good health
        and purchased it at a locked in price . A price that they ca n't come back
        and raise on me . The WL offered reasonable safe growth , certainty that allowed
        me to take more risk with my other investment choices . My whole life became
        `` if I screw everything else up , this wo n't let me down . '' My safety
        net . After 20 plus years of ownership , whole life has done what it promised
        me , been there when I needed it and did n't go backwards in 2008 when ten
        years returns were wiped off my mutual fund accounts and my home value dropped
        40 % . My boring steady unexciting whole life remained faithful to me . Now
        in my 50 's as a type II diabetic who just had his heart rebooted -LRB- cardioversion
        -RRB- because of A FIB , I really really appreciate the fact I `` OWN '' my
        policy . They ca n't raise the price , they ca n't end it . I did n't rent
        it , I OWN it . Maybe some readers will get how important that is . For all
        the financial gurus who may have said this was a bad idea , I have to ask
        why are so many people in their 60 's seeking new insurance ? Could it be
        they listened to the wrong people when they were younger and healthier ? There
        are a ton of reasons to own whole life , there is . All I can say is it is
        the most boring product you can buy . It will do what it 's supposed to ,
        without fanfare or up and down excitement . It 's the most boring financial
        product you can `` OWN '' . I hope that makes sense to some who read these
        posts .
      - Most homeowners policies have an annual adjustment for the increased costs
        of construction . This raises the limits in the policy which also raises the
        premium . With each passing year the home grows older and that also affects
        the premium . Companies often reward customers who do not have claims and
        those discounts can have a substantial effect on your premium . Occasionally
        companies will file for and receive from the state insurance commissioner
        permission to raise the rates in a specific area due to losses that exceed
        the premiums received .
      - It is possible , depending on your carrier . However , items like trampolines
        , swimming pools , swing sets etc , even if they do n't raise your homeowners
        insurance rate , certainly raise your liability exposure . For that reason
        , it is important to review the amount of liability protection your policy
        provides . Do you have enough if someopne got hurt and you were sued ? Be
        sure to have thecoverage that you need by increasing the liability coverage
        in your Homeowners policy and look into buying extra coverage in a Personal
        Umbrella Liability Policy . These begin coverage at $ 1,000,000 and can be
        increased as needed .
      - 'Years ago , it was n''t all that uncommon to see a $ 100 deductible . Those
        days are gone . Today , our standard deductible is $ 500 but I sell more deductibles
        of $ 1.000 and $ 2,500 . There ''s a reason for this . In the past , say around
        25 years ago , a homeowners policy was very basic and really only covered
        your home and contents with a few other ancillary coverages . The consumer
        was different , also . They usually only filed a claim for something big like
        a fire or tornado . About 20 years ago or so , insurance companies thought
        it would be a good idea to add more coverages for smaller things like refrigerated
        food and others . Then , a strange thing happened : People started claiming
        these things . You see , big claims like fires are very infrequent and the
        rates were built around these rarely occurring , big losses . They were n''t
        prepared for the more frequent small losses . Therefore , a $ 100 deductible
        on a total loss does n''t add much to the claim . However , insurance companies
        began seeing a lot of smaller claims and , now , that $ 100 deductible made
        it beneficial to the consumer to claim that $ 400 loss . In fact , they became
        so frequent that it was really hurting the insurance companies profitability
        . Every claim requires people to process it , adjust it , and make a payment
        . Insurance companies were seeing these costs skyrocket and they had no choice
        but to raise premiums to offset these costs . They finally reached a point
        where they had to discourage all these small losses . The way they did it
        ? they made the $ 100 and $ 250 deductible options a lot more expensive .
        So now , a $ 500 deductible is pretty standard , with higher deductibles saving
        quite a bit off the premiums . What does this mean for you ? First , realize
        that your homeowners policy was designed to cover the catastrophic losses
        , not the small things that happen more often . In Michigan , if you have
        3 claims in a 3 year period that are n''t weather-related , your company can
        cancel your policy . This will leave you in a spot where you may have to pay
        3 or 4 times the premium your used to until you ''re eligible again . A homeowners
        policy is not a maintenance contract . As a homeowner , things are going to
        happen and the responsibility for maintaining your home is yours . My advice
        is this : Take care of your home and pay for the small things and take a higher
        deductible . You ''ll probably save more before you have claim than the difference
        in the deductible . In the long run , you ''ll be protected against the big
        things and you ''ll have more money in your pocket .'

      - That is a great question ! There are a couple of reasons why a whole life
        policy makes sense . One would be if it is purchased for a young child . The
        price is locked in at that low rate for their entire life , and many companies
        will offer the opportunity to increase that coverage without any questions
        . The second is that the policy does n't end , so there is no way that you
        can outlive it . Many senior citizens purchase the policy advertised on TV
        by the large senior citizen advocate company , only to find that it ends when
        they turn 80 . Given that the average life expectancy is 84 for women and
        82 for men , for many that is a terrible surprise to find that the policy
        ends , and that getting another one is too expensive , or not available due
        to their health issues . The third is that no matter how badly your health
        declines , you have insurance that ca n't drop you , or raise your rates .
        When your term policy ends , and youwant to get another one , your age and
        health issues are re-evaluated when determining eligibility and price . Please
        feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further . Thanks
        for asking !
      - Why invest in whole life insurance ? Well it is one of the few insurance products
        that you actually control , not the insurance carrier . That is a big reason
        why whole life insurance is expensive compared to other life products . The
        insurance company bears the risk of the contract as they can not alter or
        change the terms of the contract , they can not raise the price of the policy
        in later years and must receive the policy owners permission to do anything
        to the policy . What a whole life offers is a decent return for the safety
        it provides the policy holder . There is very little investment risk to a
        whole life policy compared to other places where a person can put money .
        This also is reflected in the return . If you had money invested in 2008 you
        learned first hand about investment risk . That said , while the rest of my
        investments were losing 40 % my whole life gained value . You ca n't go backwards
        with a whole life which makes it a good part of anybody 's planning . I call
        whole life the most boring investment a person can make . Why ? it does what
        it says it will do .
      - Do you buy running shoes for a marathon form Wal-Mart ???? Do you buy a 4
        cylinder truck to pull a trailer that really demands a V8 ? My point is ,
        `` WHO CARES who has the cheapest '' . Yes , there is a way to assess apples
        to apples when buying home insurance . Red vs. green apples . There are always
        some differences in policies . However , in my state , there is a vast difference
        in plans offered . You are buying something to guard your finances in the
        event of the loss of your home , valuables , or retirement -LRB- that 's called
        Liability Coverage folks -RRB- . BUY THE MOST you can reasonably afford .
        I did a quote once and for curiosity I raised our `` in house standard amount
        of liability '' form 300K to 500K -LRB- the next step up for that carrier
        -RRB- ... What did I see ???? A ONE DOLLAR difference ... Yes ... ONE dollar
        . $ 200,000 more in coverage for a buck . That does n't happen for everyone
        and every carrier . Yet it 's almost always less than $ 10 a month . WOW ...
        200K more for $ 10 a month ... . You 'll pay the price if you buy on price
        . - gravy
      - Each renewal of your auto insurance insurance policy your carrier if they
        wish may raise your auto insurance premium . A notice of the increase in rates
        is typically sent at least thirty days before the policy comes up for renewal
        . Almost all auto insurance policies are active for a six month or one year
        term .
      - Most often the lender requires ` hazard insurance ' premiums be included in
        the escrow account . The borrower may request the insurance be added to an
        existing escrow account or one set up for the insurance premium but the untimate
        decision is up to the lender . Normally when establing escrow , the borrower
        pays the first year premium at closing and the escrow provider includes an
        additional monthly amount in the mortgage payments for the next 11 or 12 months
        so there is enough in the escrow account available to pay the renewal premium
        . What is critical here is for the borrower to keep their insurance carrier
        informed of any change in the lender 's or escrow servicing entity 's name
        , address , or account reference number . The borrower should also let the
        lender know of any changes to the insurance contract which raise or lower
        the premium . This would include an upcoming renewal premium that may be significantly
        higher -LRB- for various reasons -RRB- than the expiring premium . Many lenders
        want policies and documents to go to one address and bills to another -LRB-
        possibly the escrow servicing entity . -RRB- All borrowers must be cognizant
        of these items and proactive in notifying all interested parties . The last
        thing a borrower want is for their ` homeowners policy ' to be cancelled for
        non-payment because the escrow entity did n't receive the renewal bill so
        they could pay the renewal premium . Whenever you receive anything from an
        insurance company you have a policy with , make sure you understand what it
        is and take action immediately . In the event the policy is cancelled -LRB-
        for any reason or event -RRB- the lender will no doubt secure ` force placed
        ' hazard insurance to protect their interest -LRB- and not that of the borrower
        . -RRB- A forced placed policy will definitely be a lot more expensive premium-wise
        and a lot more restrictive coverage-wise . Not a good situation to be in and
        usually totally avoidable . So if a borrower enters this type of situation
        , they had better ` stay on top of it ' or suffer the consequences .
      - Term life insurance is life insurance that is active only for a set period
        of time . Typically term life insurance will be active for 10 , 20 , or 30
        years . Term life insurance policies typically do not accumulate a cash value
        . Whole life insurance is permanent insurance . It typically will not expire
        as long as premium payments are made as required . A whole life policy also
        will normally accumulate cash value over it 's existence which could be borrowed
        from or will in most cases raise the death benefit .
      - Health Insurance , like all forms of insurance , is based on a number of calculations
        that associated the benefit received with risk taken by the insurer . When
        you look at a state like California there are many variable factors that go
        into pricing an insurance product ; age of the insured , current health status
        , smoker or non smoker , current profession , current address , who will be
        covered under the policy , etc. . California has one of the highest cost of
        living indexes around so as that is factored into pricing an insurance product
        , it affects the bottom line . To help ease the cost of health insurance here
        you can look at things like -LRB- 1 -RRB- raising your deductible -LRB- 2
        -RRB- lowering the amount of co payment you want insurance to cover and -LRB-
        3 -RRB- reducing the amount of benefits associated with your policy .
      - People would buy term life insurance to cover a temporary need . E.g. Most
        people need more coverage while raising children . Term insurance costs less
        than permanent , and there will not be a need for that much coverage after
        the children are grown . So for that purpose , 20 to 30 year Term works well
        . Some loan companies require term insurance to protect them if the borrower
        should pass away . Term insurance is well suited to temporary needs .
      - 'This calculator can help you determine how much life insurance you need with
        one child : WEBSITELINK It allows you to put in the age of the child , along
        with other factors , to give you a suggested amount of life insurance . Or
        you can estimate what it would cost to raise your child to adulthood , including
        inflation , and determine how much income would be lost if the insured person
        were to pass . Then replace that lost income with life insurance .'

      - 'Maybe one should not get long-term care insurance . Let ''s start there .
        If an individual or a family has a sizeable estate that either is liquid or
        can be liquidated and be made readily available to pay for the cost of long-term
        care , maybe long-term care is n''t needed . If , on the other extreme , you
        have a very small estate comprised of no real estate and very little personal
        property of any worth and will rely almost entirely on Social Security in
        retirement , you ca n''t afford long-term care premiums , now or in the future
        . You will have to have a plan , however , in case you do need long-term care
        . A family discussion around the topic should be scheduled so that those that
        might become either temporary or permanent caregivers are fully apprised of
        the responsibilities and sacrifices that may have to be made . Medicaid qualification
        should be fully investigated and the benefits and limitations understood .
        People buy long-term care for roughly the same reason they buy life insurance
        . One buys life insurance because they care about the financial security of
        those that are left behind . One buys long-term care insurancebecause they
        care about those that might have to take care of them if they ca n''t take
        care of themselves . Long-term care costs are not covered by conventional
        health insurance , Medicare , and most Medicare supplement insurance . They
        can be very expensive , especially ifthe elderly person lives a long-period
        of time in a state of incapacity . Caregivers will be spouses and adult children
        are likely to be caregivers whether one owns long-term care insurance or not
        . Long-term care insurance is for caregivers . It gives them choices about
        the quality of care that can be afforded and whether they can be relieved
        of some of the responsibility for caregiving . Many elderly spouses of those
        that ca n''t take care of themselves become disabled themselves because of
        the emotional and psychological energy expended in caregiving . Adult children
        sometimes get caught in a conflict over eldercare and parenting growing children
        . Long-term care insurance provides income-tax-free money to hire trained
        individuals to care for loved ones . Ultimately , it allows the insured to
        die with dignity and peace . Getting back to the wealthy that do n''t need
        to buy long-term care insurance , guess what ? Many wealthy couples and individuals
        do . They understand leverage : paying smaller dollars now for larger dollars
        later , if needed . They also understand that in many situations , premiums
        for long-term care may be tax-deductible . What about the middle class ? They
        would have to design their coverage to help offset the cost of long-term care
        . No matter how much one spends , no long-term care insurance policy can guarantee
        to cover all possible long-term care expenses . But , the average claim is
        about 24 - 26 months . Buying a long-term care policy with a pool of money
        sufficient to cover at least part of those costs would be prudent . Is buying
        a basic plan for long-term care that would pay only half of one ''s long-term
        care costs be a bad deal ? I do n''t think anyone that ''s paying $ 400/day
        for facility care and being reimbursed for $ 200/day would find that of no
        value .'
      - 'A better question would be `` Who Should n''t Buy Long-term Care Insurance
        '''' ? Thats simpler to answer . The following people should NOT buy long
        term care insurance : 1 . Those that can not afford the premium on even a
        base policy . 2 . Those that have virtually no assets to pass on to the next
        generationand will need every available dollar saved for retirement . 3 .
        Those that will have to work until they die for lack of savings and insufficient
        Social Security payments or private pension . 4 . Those that can not medically
        qualify . 5 . Those that are already unable to perform regular daily activities
        of living without assistance . People in those conditions may qualify for
        the payment of long-term care through Medicaid -LRB- MediCal in California
        -RRB- if they come to a point in their life where they need care and ca n''t
        afford it . If the above conditions describe you in any way , you should be
        sitting down with your adult children or closest relatives and coming up with
        a plan of action should you be unable to take care of yourself . Everyone
        else should consider buying some long-term care insurance through an agent
        or agency that either specializes or has a specialist that is experienced
        in handling long-term care insurance casework . Having some amount of insurance
        is better than having none . When one qualifies to receive payments from the
        insurance company for long-term care , they are usually near the end of their
        life . The average long-term care claim is approximately 2 - 2.5 years . For
        those that need care longer than that , virtually all but the most unusual
        claims are paid out after 5 years . Families with a history of late-life mental
        illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers -RRB- should consider buying a larger
        pool of money than others , if they can afford it . It is in the best interest
        of the adult children to help out with long-term care premium payments if
        the elderly parents can not afford to pay all of the costs . Long-term care
        is an emotional , psychological , sociological , and family problem as much
        as it is financial . For the dignity of those who need care and the people
        or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs to be a plan of action
        determined and long-term care insurance should be a part of that plan if it
        can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term care insurance
        is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during the life
        of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design of
        the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one needs
        long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today
        . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care
        costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there ''s not
        much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary
        by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation
        may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility .'
      - 'Short answer : About 8 % Long answer : It ''s hard to say exactly how many
        people own some type of policy that covers paying the costs of long term care
        - should one qualify for it - because there are many types of insurance policies
        that are not just `` stand-alone '''' long-term care policies , but plans
        of insurance that include being able to use a percentage of other plan benefits
        for paying long-term care costs :1 . Stand-alone long-term care insurance
        covers only long-term care costs . It has no cash value . When a policy owner
        dies , coverage either lapses or stops paying benefits . It is not transferable
        . It can not be bought or sold on a secondary market . This type of long-term
        care insurance is sometimes referred to as `` traditional '''' long-term care
        insurance , as well . It is the type of coverage that is most often associated
        with the `` percentage of Americans that own their own long-term care insurance
        '''' .2 . Hybrid long-term care contracts consist of having long-term coverage
        and a life insurance policy that guarantees to at least return the full premium
        paid into the policy to the insured ''s designated beneficiary . Usually ,
        these are single-premium contracts , but some have options to also pay over
        a specified period of time , such as 5 - or 10-years .3 . Linked life + long-term
        care policies are basically a traditional permanent life insurance contract
        -LRB- Whole Life or Universal Life , including the Variable or Indexed type
        -RRB- . If a person qualifies for long-term care and they have the long-term
        care rider on their life policy , they may apply to the insurance company
        to advance or accelerate the face value of the policy -LRB- death benefit
        -RRB- to pay for the costs of care . There are various limitations on how
        much can be advanced at a time . If the face value of the life contract is
        completely advanced for long-term care , there is usually a residual death
        benefit of $ 5,000 - $ 10,000.4 . The latest addition to life insurance product
        lines are policies offering `` living benefits '''' , one of which is very
        similar to the linked-life policy . In fact , the only difference is that
        a medical professional has to state in writing that the insured is not likely
        to recover from the condition that qualifies for long-term care benefits .
        -LRB- True long-term care insurance does not require that . -RRB- This type
        of living benefit is most often referred to as `` chronic care '''' or ``
        extended care '''' . Annuities may also have special considerations for paying
        out portions of the account value for long-term care costs.The point is ,
        people who own life insurance or annuity contracts with long-term care accommodations
        are not typically included in with the 8 % that own traditional long-term
        care . So , the real percentage of those that have made some type of insurance
        purchase to offset long-term care costs is greater than 8 % . I doubt , however
        , that the total percentage of Americans that own any of the above-described
        types of policies would exceed 20 % at this time .'
      - Roughly sixty percent of Americans will require long term care services sometime
        during their lifetime . This is not exclusively a problem for the elderly
        as younger people can require this type of care some times . This level of
        care includes a range of services including skilled and custodial care that
        is provided over a long period of time . These requirements come from chronic
        sickness or injury , cognitive impairment and physical disability . Hospitals
        provide acute care . Medical care given over a long period of time for chronic
        conditions is where the need for long term care arises . Sometimes custodial
        care is required because the patient has lost the ability to do one of the
        recognized activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily
        living . Most of the long term care given in the US is given by family members
        . However , there are many situations where family members can not provide
        necessary care . Professional and non-professionals can provide aid and assistance
        to these people . This long term care can be given in the home of the patient
        or in a variety of institutional settings . Long term care can be given in
        day-care facilities , nursing homes , and assisted living facilities . On
        average men need more than two years of long term care while women need almost
        four years on average ? The leading causes for patients requiring long term
        care are dementia , arthritis , cancer , stroke and nervous conditions . Caring
        for a patient in a home setting can cost up to $ 150,000 per year . The cost
        for a nursing home bed is about $ 75,000 per year -LRB- this varies by location
        . -RRB- There are basically four ways to finance long term care . The family
        can take the expense out of their own pocket , they can look to government
        programs -LRB- if they qualify , -RRB- they can use long term care insurance
        or they can rely upon charity . For a variety of reasons long term care insurance
        has provided a solution for many people . LTC insurance provides predictability
        for an otherwise unpredictable risk . It has become such popular coverage
        and policyholders have been so reluctant to drop their coverage that the benefits
        have started exceeding the premiums . It is quite popular among wealthy policyholders
        . Many companies that offered coverage have withdrawn and others have been
        forced to raise their premiums . This adjustment seems to be complete now
        . There are various forms of LTC coverage . Policies different widely . It
        is rather difficult to compare but is worth the effort . When deciding on
        a policy the first thing to establish is the amount of coverage you want and
        the period of time you want coverage . The second consideration is how soon
        after the start of long term care will you want the policy to start paying
        . This waiting period is computed in several ways so care must be exercised
        to make sure you are making a fair comparison . Not all policies use the same
        events to trigger benefits so care should be taken in this area as well .
        This can be a very technical area so compare your situation with the policy
        requirements . How a policy pays out will vary according to the policy . Some
        policies provide for reimbursement of expenses , others use an indemnity form
        which pays up to a specific limit of expenses incurred on each specific day
        , and some are on a cash model which pays a maximum benefit regardless of
        the actual cost of the care that is being given . Long term care insurance
        is a way to protect assets . The alternatives deplete assets with the government
        programs requiring a person to be in poverty .
      - Long Term Health Care Insurance is called , simply , Long Term Care Insurance
        . It covers the cost of living in a nursing home , assisted living home ,
        or receiving other types of services when the insured person is unable to
        take care of themselves . Among those who should buy Long Term Care Insurance
        are those who have many assets and feel strongly that they do not want their
        assets to go toward paying long term care expenses . People who want to have
        many choices in how and where they are cared for , should they be unable to
        care for themselves , are also people who would benefit from Long Term Care
        insurance , if they can afford it . Finally , persons whose families want
        the security of knowing that their parents will not rely on them for long
        term care , if needed , are those who should considering buying Long Term
        Care insurance .
      - Not everyone needs long term care insurance . LTCI is not for persons who
        are struggling to meet their day to day living expenses , rent an apartment
        , and have little savings and no investments . If such a person needed to
        go to a nursing home , Medicaid will almost immediately start picking up their
        tab and they will be fine . Long term care insurance is for those who have
        substantial assets or income that they do n't want to `` lose '' by paying
        high long term care costs . Some people are OK with their savings going to
        long term care expenses , if needed . They figure that is why they saved .
        Others feel strongly that they want to pass that wealth to heirs to continue
        a business , care for a disabled adult child , or help grandchildren go to
        college , among a myriad of other reasons . It is this latter segment of the
        population that `` needs '' long term care insurance , especially if they
        are not so very wealthy that paying nursing home expenses for many years would
        simply dent their resources , rather than deplete them . If they can afford
        long term care insurance , but would not be able to to pay for long term care
        services , people who are adamant about choosing the type of care they receive
        , or persons who are setting up a plan so that their children do n't have
        to worry about it , also could use long term care insurance . As long as Medicaid
        is around , no one absolutely needs long term care insurance . But for all
        the reasons above , many people would consider it a need if they looked at
        it realistically .
      - 70 % of people who are 65 years old will need to use some type of long term
        care in their lifetime . And , as they age the likelihood of needing long
        term care will increase . The cost for this care is very expensive and it
        is not covered by conventional health insurance - commercial carriers or Medicare
        . This is because our health care system is geared to acute care not long
        term care . According to the 2015 Genworth survey the national average cost
        for a semi-private room in a nursing home is about $ 80,000 . More , for a
        private room . Home Health care costs average $ 20/hour . These expense arise
        when most people are living on a fixed income with little room for added expenses
        . Especially , unplanned ones . Baby boomers have not been great at planning
        for retirement . One year of long term care can ruin someone 's retirement
        plans . This is what happens in many cases ; families deplete their assets
        and end up qualifying for Medicaid -LRB- aka Welfare -RRB- to pay for long
        term care expenses . The question people need to ask themselves is when the
        need for long term care arises , will they have the money to pay for this
        care ? This is what long term care insurance can do for them . Insurance is
        the only financial vehicle that promises a specific amount of money at a point
        in time . There is no other . Even though this can be an expensive premium
        , depending on the age at which the policy is purchased , compared to the
        benefits paid , it is worth the outlay for most people . Not only because
        it will help pay the bills . Long term care insurance policies offer additional
        benefits that most people are unaware of . Most importantly , all carriers
        offer optional care management to assist with the difficult decisions about
        care , choosing facilities and offering discounts on major providers of care
        . Many times families need someone to discuss options with who is educated
        about all the options available and is n't emotionally involved with their
        situation . This is where the care manager can be of tremendous help and the
        family does not have to go to the expense of hiring a geriatric care manager
        . The policies will also pay for modifications to be made to the home to keep
        the person at home rather than moving them to a nursing home .
      - The average cost of long-term care insurance depends on a number of factors
        as the policies are very customizable . If you 're looking for a more basic
        option , I would estimate a range of around $ 1,800 - $ 2,300 per year in
        premiums . If you want something more comprehensive , you 're probably looking
        at something more so in the range of $ 4,000 - $ 6,000 per year . The most
        comprehensive plans can be $ 7,000 or more per year . Factors such as the
        person 's age , health , only applying as an individual , applying as a married
        couple , daily benefit levels , benefit periods , compound inflation options
        , elimination/waiting periods , and other items will really impact what the
        cost for a plan will be . In today 's world , there 's a very good chance
        you will need long-term care at some point in your life . If you were paying
        for long-term care out of pocket , you can expect to be writing a check for
        at least $ 40,000 per year - something more specialized like a nursing home
        , then possibly well over $ 100,000 per year . Unfortunately , not too many
        people can write that check . While writing a check for several thousand dollars
        a year in premiums for long-term care coverage can have a bit of sticker shock
        , it can potentially save you 10 's of thousands of dollars in the future
        if it happens to you . So the idea of the coverage is to transfer the risk
        to the insurance company in exchange for a small premium and use their money
        rather than your own to pay for the expenses if that care is ever needed .
        The long and short being that the `` average cost '' is an irrelevant figure
        . It only gives you an idea . The actual cost you can expect to pay depends
        on your needs and what you want to accomplish with the coverage . From there
        you can start to compare numbers . I would suggest speaking with an independent
        insurance agent who works with long-term care insurance products and can compare
        multiple companies for you . An agent can help you sort through all the zigs
        and zags of long-term care insurance and help determine what coverage will
        best serve your needs . If you need help with your coverage , please feel

        group with a strong background in long-term care insurance . I hope the information
        is helpful - please let me know if you have any other questions . Thanks very
        much .
      - 'Whether long-term care insurance should be `` mandated '''' requires an associated
        question : `` Mandated by whom ? '''' Also , any question that includes the
        word `` should '''' involves a question of values and may fall into a political
        category of some kind.The question , however , is a good one . We have a looming
        crisis that has only just begun . Millions of people will soon be at the age
        of possibly needing extended care before they pass away . The current `` baby
        boom '''' demographic has hit retirement age and is about 20-30 years from
        cresting at an age that many may need care before dying . Unless there are
        many medical advances , care accommodations , and/or technological improvements
        for elder care , hundreds of thousands of people in their 70s , 80s , and
        90s and beyond will need assistance in successfully performing the activities
        of day-to-day life , such as feeding oneself , getting from one place to another
        , dressing , bathing , etc.Who is going to provide that care ? First , it
        will be family -LRB- spouse and/or adult children , if available -RRB- , but
        beyond that , there is only Medicaid -LRB- Medical in CA -RRB- to provide
        care services . The problem is that one must become `` indigent '''' to qualify
        for government aid , and one must be admitted to an approved facility to receive
        care . -LRB- Medicare currently only provides hospital , recovery , and skilled
        nursing care for a maximum period of 100 days . A hospital stay for a minimum
        of three days is required to qualify in most cases . -RRB- If the questioner
        is asking should the government be mandated to provide long-term care , then
        this is entirely a political question . The government , ultimately , is the
        tax-payer . Congress is the body of our government that legislates laws.If
        the questioner is asking should everyone be mandated to purchase their own
        long-term care coverage , the answer is probably `` no '''' . Even though
        that might seem like a solution , the cost of privately-owned long-term care
        is currently far beyond the reach of many Americans . Some could not even
        afford the premiums of a base policy which would n''t come close to paying
        what long-term care might end up costing.A commission formed by Congress is
        currently meeting to debate and hear testimony on the question of how we ,
        as a society , will handle those that have no family or other support group
        , do not own long-term care insurance , and are `` taking too long to die
        '''' . This makes the question a moral one , and one that deserves an answer
        so that people may die with dignity .'
      - No , Disability Insurance is not the same as Long Term Care Insurance , although
        they do have a lot of similarities . Long Term Disability Insurance pays persons
        who are unable to work at their regular jobs because of becoming disabled
        . There is an elimination period , just like Long Term Care , and there may
        be a limit on the years of benefit , just like LTC -LRB- these are determined
        when taking out the policy -RRB- . But the amount the Disability Insurance
        pays is a percent of what those employees made in their jobs and can be used
        however they wish . For Long Term Care Insurance , there must be certain conditions
        met besides just being unable to work at one 's job , order to receive benefits
        . These triggers include inability to do 2-3 activities of daily living independently
        , cognitive/mental impairment , and nursing home or other long term care ordered
        by a doctor . The payments might be paid to the insured persons or they might
        be paid directly to the facilities offering the care , depending on the type
        of policy that was purchased .
      - Long Term Health Insurance -LRB- known as Long Term Care Insurance -RRB- is
        worth it for some people and not for others . If you have a large amount of
        savings , investments , and/or property , Long Term Care Insurance can protect
        your estate by paying for the cost of caring for you if you can not care for
        yourself . If you have very little in the way of assets , LTCI may not be
        worth it , as Medicaid would cover the cost of staying in a nursing home .
        However , whether you have a large estate or not , Long Term Care Insurance
        does provide some freedom in choosing where you receive your care . And for
        some people that is worth the price of the insurance .
      - Long Term Care is the elephant in the room . Many carriers have exited the
        market because they were not able to make money in this niche . The question
        you should be asking is what will happen if my spouse or I require care ?
        You will not find any good answer unless you have coverage or can afford the
        $ 70,000 per year plus that it costs . The changes of needing care are high
        , but not for a long period of time . In addition , there are several other
        ways of paying for long term care with life insurance and annuity riders that
        you should investigate .
      - Long Term Care Insurance is insurance that pays for extended care needs of
        persons who are no longer able to care for themselves due to illness or injury
        . To begin receiving the benefits of a long term care insurance policy , the
        insured person must show that they can not do at least two activities of daily
        living on their own -LRB- such as dressing , bathing , etc -RRB- . Cognitive
        impairment is also a trigger for LTC insurance to pay out . People purchase
        long term care insurance to empower themselves in their later years by not
        having to liquidate their estate to pay for this huge expense , and also to
        use the policy to purchase the type of long term care that they desire .
      - Everyone comes into the discussion about long term care insurance from a different
        angle , because we all have different experiences . As an insurance website
        , we rightfully describe the financial implications of the products in question
        . But as human beings , we interject our experiences , as well . Some of us
        see it from the view of the caregiver/family , having been caregivers by default
        for a parent who did not have long term care insurance , or watched our ``
        healthy '' parent struggle to care for the sick one . Some of us have adult
        children urging us to get long term care insurance because they know that
        they would have to give up homes and jobs to come care for us . Some of us
        see it from the view of the person needing the care . Time spent in a nursing
        home quickly reveals those who could have had a higher quality life living
        in their own home , with the resources that LTC insurance provides . There
        are the `` rich '' in the single room whose resources are dwindling with each
        passing year , and who may eventually not be able to sustain that luxury of
        a private room by having to go on Medicaid . No matter what angle from which
        you view it , there are good reasons to get long term care insurance . There
        are also reasons not to get it , as Mr. Bridgers so eloquently stated about
        both sides .
      - Under Medicare any type of Home Health Care is limited . They will provide
        some skilled care on a temporary basis but Medicare generally will not pay
        for custodial care in any long term care environment . That is why it is important
        to carry some type of Long Term Care Insurance that will provide Home Health
        Care . Some policies even pay family members for providing care . A good agent
        who does long term care planning can help you find a program that will help
        .
      - 'Most advisers begin addressing long term care insurance with the clients
        around age 50 . But the buying public tends to purchase long term care insurance
        around age 60 . A couple of considerations here : You want to buy long term
        care when your healthy an relatively young to afford the premiums . But even
        if youre healthy , whats the predisposition of your family regarding assisted
        living and nursing home confinement ? If theres negative health history ,
        then buying long term care earlier may be more prudent .'
      - My parents applied for Long Term Care Insurance many years ago , and my mother
        was able to qualify for it , but my father was not . My father 's declined
        over these many years , and toward the end , it was a worry whether my mom
        could continue to care for him or not . Thankfully , she was , but it was
        a difficult situation , to say the least . Now my mom has long term care insurance
        and you can tell it brings her peace . Even though she does not have anyone
        at home to care for her , like she did for Dad , she will have the funds to
        do what she needs to do if she can not care for herself . This personal experience
        has made it more real to me that , if you are not close to qualifying for
        Medicaid , you should probably have Long Term Care Insurance .
      - 'Long Term Care Insurance is not an investment at all . It is a morbidity
        insurance product to fund long term care expenses , generally a defensive
        planning tactic during retirement . If the question is along the lines of
        : Is long term care insurance money worth spending , then the answer is yes
        . If you dont have long term care , then your investments will be at risk
        to the expenditures of extended care during your senior years .'
      - What 's the best age to buy Long Term Care Insurance ? There are many opinions
        as to the answer for that question , offered by professionals in the insurance
        field and in by professionals in the field of issues related to aging . As
        someone who has a background in both fields , I think the best age to purchase
        Long Term Care Insurance is by age 60 . Rates are lower and you are less likely
        to have a medical condition to disqualify you than if you wait longer than
        that . Some cite statistics that over 40 % of Long Term Care is provided to
        persons under age 65 , so you should purchase LTC coverage at a much younger
        age . But many of the younger persons in extended care facilities have mental
        illness or other lifelong conditions that would not have qualified them for
        LTC insurance in the first place . It is certainly true that the younger you
        are , the lower the rates , but you do have to offset the extra years for
        which you will be making those payments . More important than that , I believe
        , is getting the policy while you still qualify . If you see some health conditions
        sneaking up on you at age 40 that could be trouble at age 60 , get your Long
        Term Care coverage while you can .

      - Medicare will not pay for Nicorette gum or patch , or other smoking cessation
        products . When making the effort to quit smoking , Medicare will pay forup
        to 8 face-to-face smoking cessation counseling sessions with a qualified Medicare
        doctor during a 12 month period .
      - The answer to your question will vary from health insurance carrier to health
        insurance carrier and may also be determined by whether your employer 's coverage
        is self-funded and they have made a determination about the coverage of nicotine
        gum . Coverage for smoking cessationprograms has almost universally been adopted
        by health insurance carriers for its obvious positive effects on the health
        of their members . However , what treatments and medications they will cover
        for smoking cessation are determined by each insurance carrier and are not
        uniform across the industry . You should check with your health insurance
        provider 's customer service department to get more detailed information about
        what your coverage is in this regard . My general experience is that the nicotine
        patch is more likely to be covered than nicotine gum . Also , there are several
        prescription medications that are available for use in smoking cessation and
        you may find that some or all of these are covered by your health insurance
        .
      - Zyban is chemically similar to Buproprion . Both medications are used to treat
        depression but also can be used as part of a smoking cessation program . Buproprion
        is covered by Medicare Part D and does not require prior authorization from
        your carrier . Zyban may be prescribed by your doctor as part of a smoking
        cessation program if other treatment protocols have not worked . Medicare
        Part D may require prior authorization .
      - Health insurance cost more for smokers om most medical plans . The exception
        is a `` short-term '' policy with selected carriers . For temporary policies
        , often the smoking status is not considered in determining the rate . When
        State Exchanges/Marketplaces begin offering coverage -LRB- You should continue
        to purchase coverage through a broker and/or their website -RRB- in 2014 ,
        smoking will impact all plans . Although any existing conditions will not
        impact the rate , smoking will . So if you can stop , it will save money .
        If you ca n't , many smoking cessation expenses will be covered under the
        new plans .
      - Smokers are considered a health risk and unfortunately will always pay a higher
        premium . The serious health conditions that are associated with smoking means
        smokers have a shorter life expectancy . If one is a smoker the best course
        of action would be to seek some type of smoking cessation program . One small
        word of advice ; if your option is the electronic cigarette this will show
        up in the para-meds as nicotine usage . In some cases it will afford you a
        lower premium however your rating class with most insurance companies will
        be listed as smoker .
      - The answer to your question will vary from insurance carrier to insurance
        carrier . While smoking cessation program coverage has become almost standard
        in health insurance policies , the approved methods and medications are determined
        by each health insurance carrier . As such , there is no simple , Yes or No
        answer to your question . You will need to check with your insurance carrier
        to determine what your plan with them covers and the steps you need to take
        to have your efforts to stop smoking covered . In general terms , nicotine
        patches seem to be more favored by health insurance carriers than nicotine
        gum . Also , there are several prescription medications that are approved
        for smoking cessation and are generally covered under the pharmacy benefit
        of most health insurers .
      - As a general rule , Medicare does not cover hypnotherapy . If your doctor
        or therapist recommends hypnosis for weight loss or smoking cessation , the
        treatment is not covered . But in some cases Medicare can pay for hypnotherapy
        . If hypnosis is used in conjunction with treatment for PTSD or pain management
        it may be a covered expense .
      - It depends on your policy but more and more companies are paying for smoking
        cessation programs prescribed by a doctor . It depends on the company so check
        with your agent or call the company to receive a more definitive answer to
        your question . Your agent or customer service can help you .
      - If you only have Medicare A & B or Parts A & B plus a Medigap plan , Medicare
        is going to pay first . When you have more than one plan paying a claim ,
        the process has to follow the coordination of benefits rules to determine
        who pays first and who pays second . The majority of the time , people who
        are on Medicare will have two types of coverage when they or their spouse
        works for an employer . Self-employed individuals will generally only be on
        Medicare and drop their under 65 policy -LRB- unless their spouse has group
        coverage they can be on -RRB- . How big the company is and whether or not
        the insured employee is working will generally determine who pays first .
        If the employer has 20 or more employees , the employer plan will pay first
        and Medicare second . If the employer has less than 20 employees , Medicare
        will pay first and the employer will pay second . If you 're on Medicare for
        a disability , the employer plan pays first and Medicare pays second if there
        are 100 or more employees - if there are less than 100 employees , Medicare
        pays first and the employer plan pays second .
      - If you only have Medicare A & B or Parts A & B plus a Medigap plan , Medicare

        be of further assistance . Thanks very much .
      - COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . It manifests itself
        in chronic bronchitis , emphysema , or -LRB- most commonly -RRB- a combination
        of the two . Most COPD is caused by a history of smoking and is progressive
        in nature . When applying for life insurance , underwriters will look at pulmonary
        function , whether or not the patient is still smoking , severity and frequency
        of symptoms , and whether portable oxygen is used . Very mild COPD may qualify
        for medically underwritten coverage . Generally , simplified issue policies
        must be used for persons with moderate to severe COPD . If oxygen is used
        , the applicant will most likely need to purchase guaranteed issue life insurance
        , if it is available at their age .
      - 'Some other characteristics include the following : 1 . Occupational class
        : A category the insured falls into based on their job title and specif duties
        . The occ class dictates the premium . 2 . Rating : This comes when an underwriter
        approves an application , but with a higher than normal premium because the
        insured is a higher risk -LRB- typically due to their health history , smoking
        history , weight , etc. -RRB- . The rating can be anything from 15 to 100
        % more in premium , though it can often times be reconsidered after a few
        years if the client loses and keeps off weight , stops smoking , etc. 3 .
        Cost of living rider -LRB- COLA -RRB- : This optional benefit increases the
        disability benefit by a certain percentage , typically determined by the latest
        Consumer Price Index .'
      - I 'm not aware of any health insurance plans that require blood and/or urine
        tests to qualify for . That said , the information is usually available through
        past medical history and may be found in the MIB -LRB- Medical Information
        Bureau -RRB- or your current doctor 's chart notes . The risk for someone
        who is a smoker and omits that information , is a cancelled policy . Usually
        this would occur at the worst possible time , during the filing of a large
        claim . With smoking , some states do not apply the 2 year contestibility
        clause and consider a contract between the insurer and insured to never have
        existed , so premiums are refunded . While with health insurance you may not
        be tested for smoking , they reserve and you consent to the right for them
        to check your health history , so any doctor you 've told or any treatment
        you 've had the possibility would exist that there is a record of it .
      - The cost of life insurance for a smoker varies with age , gender and build
        , just as it does for life insurance for a nonsmoker . However , when you
        throw in a health condition , being a smoker can increase premiums much more
        than it does for a nonsmoker . Smoking while having diabetes , heart disease
        , COPD , even osteoporosis , can cause rates to jump exponentially , or even
        be declined . One way to get around this can be to purchase a simplified issue
        life insurance policy . Their smoker rates tend to not have quite as large
        a variation as medically underwritten policies , and they may not be as strict
        about the impact of smoking upon that health condition . There are also medically
        underwritten policies that treat smokers much better than others . Contact
        an agency that specializes in smoker life insurance to get your most competitive
        rate .
      - Smoking affects life insurance rates but how much depends on other health
        and lifestyle factors . In general , the premium for term life insurance for
        people in their thirties and forties is three times more for tobacco users
        than for non tobacco users . The factor widens on older individuals . For
        permanent -LRB- cash value -RRB- policies the difference is not as great .
        The kind of smoking or tobacco use affects rates , too . In recent years ,
        a few innovative insurance companies have been offering non tobacco rates
        to cigar smokers and users of smokeless tobacco making their tobacco class
        rates effectively cigarette user rates . Celebratory cigar use e.g. once or
        twice a year at weddings , may even qualify at such innovative insurance companies
        for preferred non tobacco premium rates .
      - That is a really good question ! Every insurance company will try to sell
        you on the fact that they are the `` best '' . The truth is that there is
        often not a lot that separates one policy from the other , especially when
        it comes to straight term policies . So what makes one company `` better ''
        than the next ? There are companies that underwrite differently , and if you
        have an issue , then the one that writes best for your issue is `` best ''
        . Or if you like the occasional cigar , but otherwise do n't smoke , then
        a company that does n't count that cigar as smoking is `` best '' . A good
        independent agent can help find the company that can best suit you . Thanks
        for asking !
      - That is a great question ! In the case of you purchasing a policy for a larger
        face value , the insurance company will send out a para-med who will take
        samples or swabs from you to test for the markers of nicotine use . In the
        case of a smaller face value policy , there will be a question on your application
        , and then subsequent ones relating to smoking related diseases . If at some
        point the company has reason to believe that your answers during the application
        process are less than truthful , they may elect to deny or delay your payment
        on those grounds . The best thing to do is quit smoking , or find a company
        that is lenient with their tobacco rules , or one that does n't ask at all
        . They exist , and a good agent can find one for you . I hope that helps ,
        thanks for asking !
      - That is a great question ! If you are asking because you are trying to get
        a cheaper rate , I 'd advise you not to try , though . If , God forbid , you
        die as a result of a smoking related illness , and it states that in your
        death certificate , and you were listed as a non smoker , you can bet your
        last dollar that your beneficiary will have a hard time collecting . If the
        company suspects that you were fraudulent on your application , rest assured
        they will not be happy . Please just sign it as smoking , then after you 've
        quit and are clean , revise your policy and get the cheaper rate . It 's a
        much better way to do it . Thank you for asking !

        are taking an exam to get a life insurance , you are providing evidence of
        insurability . It is whatever is required to show that you are qualified to
        obtain that policy . When life insurance does not require EOI , that can make
        the policy very expensive , as in guaranteed issue life insurance , which
        has no evidence of insurability requirements . However , sometimes no EOI
        can be a perk . E.g Many term policies offer the opportunity to convert them
        to permanent policies without evidence of insurability . That is a perk ,
        especially if your health deteriorates and you can not qualify for a new term
        policy . It is a double perk in that the converted permanent policy will be

        the insured person meets the health and risk criteria required by that company
        in order to get a certain policy . Group life insurance plans might not require
        EOI for a certain amount of life insurance , but then require EOI for additional
        coverage , or coverage for family members . Most privately purchased policies
        do have EOI requirements of some kind , although they can vary widely from
        simply answering a few questions to having a full medical exam done .

      - 'Here is what Suze says about permanent insurance on her website : I HATE
        WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE I HATE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE I HATE VARIABLE LIFE
        INSURANCE THE ONLY TYPE I LIKE FOR THE PURPOSES FOR INSURING YOUR LIFE IS
        TERM INSURANCE ! If you are smart with the money you have today and you get
        rid of your mortgages , car loans and credit card debt and put money into
        retirement plans you dont need insurance 30 years from now to protect your
        family when you die . WEBSITELINK Lets think about this perspective for a
        second . She basically believes that family protection is the sole reason
        why people buy life insurance . Once the kids are out of the house , and you
        dont have any more debt , and you can afford to self-insure , you dont need
        a policy . This may be true for some people , but it is not true for many
        others . Consider some of the what ifs : What if your elder parents become
        dependent on you ? What if you need to secure a pension distribution ? What
        if you incur an estate tax obligation ? What if you want to leave a gift to
        your favorite charity ? What if you start a business when you retire as many
        people do and you need to indemnify a loan , or fund a partnership agreement
        ? These are all reasons for why people need life insurance after the family
        protection stage . They should be considered when people do their life insurance
        planning .'
      - 'This is a really good question . Everybody asks it . You do have some options
        . Lets see what the ramifications would be of choosing each one . You could
        drop it when you feel it has outlived its use . Lets suppose you originally
        bought a policy for family protection . But now , the kids are out of the
        house . You probably feel you dont need life insurance any more . But what
        about the next stage of your life ? And the stage after that ? What if you
        need to maximize your pension distribution ? What if a child - or for that
        matter a parent - becomes dependent on you later in life ? What if you want
        to leave a legacy of charitable bequests ? What if you want to start a business
        after you retire , and need to indemnify a bank loan ? Sure , you could always
        pick up coverage at that point . You think . Assuming you qualify medically
        and otherwise . And assuming you want to pay the extra cost due to a higher
        age . Then again , you could drop it when you feel you can afford to self-insure
        . So now you have a accumulated a sizable portfolio of assets . Your net worth
        is right up there . Why should you pay for life insurance when there is so
        much money at the disposal of your heirs ? But if you have demonstrated such
        savvy in reaching this pinnacle of success , you would certainly consider
        the following : What percentage of your asset portfolio is liquid ? Life insurance
        would pay your beneficiaries within days . If any bills have to get paid right
        off the bat , they will need liquidity . What about a estate equalization
        ? Some of your heirs may be in business with you and therefore inherit the
        firm . What about your children who are not working with you ? You probably
        want to take care of them as well . Life insurance could give them the same
        value as those children who inherit your business property . How about estate
        taxation ? Why would you want to pay Uncle Sam a ton of money dollar for dollar
        when you could have a life insurance policy take care of that obligation for
        pennies on the dollar ? The bottom line is that you could drop your life insurance
        any time you want . You just need to be prepared to face the consequences
        .'
      - If you were to cover every contingency of life with life insurance , you probably
        could not afford that much . Life insurance is a wonderful resource for the
        `` what if 's '' of life , but the `` what if 's '' can be endless . What
        if you died leaving your family without your income . What if before you died
        , you used up all your savings on doctor bills . Then , what if your spouse
        died shortly after you . What if the person you designated to care for your
        children , had just lost their job . What if ... . No one can have enough
        life insurance to cover every possible tragedy . But you can have enough life
        insurance to give your loved ones a chance . Providing them with enough income
        to give them time to adjust to life without you , without having to worry
        about getting a new job -LRB- or adding a second job to the one they already
        have -RRB- , is a good place to start . Giving them enough to live on until
        your children are grown , or for 10 years , is also a reasonable amount .
      - A nearly impossible question to answer . How much premium can you afford ?
        What carrier are you purchasing coverage with ? What is your health/medical
        history ? What is your family/medical history ? What is your occupation ?
        What is your geographic location ? What is you age ? What is you height/weight
        ? These are just some of the factors used to determine the amount of coverage
        and the premium that you would pay for that coverage ; that a carrier might
        use . Most carriers will handle coverage rates up to one million on a regular
        basis . Contact a local agent to find out what would be available to you .
      - 'here is a good chance you will . Lets cover some of the what ifs : What if
        you need to maximize your pension distribution by taking it out during your
        lifetime only ? Life insurance will help you cover your spouse . What if you
        have any remaining debts , such as a second mortgage ? Or if you have any
        dependents , such as a child who still need some financial assistance ? Life
        insurance would protect them . What if you want a really strong guaranteed
        portion of your asset portfolio ? The guarantees in life insurance cash value
        contracts are very competitive . What if your net worth is high and you want
        to preserve your estate from federal and state taxation ? Life insurance would
        allow you to protect your assets and still pay the government . What if you
        have formed very strong ties with a charity , and would like to support it
        as a legacy ? Life insurance can turn a comparatively small premium into a
        very substantial gift for them . Its kind of surprising , isnt it , about
        how our need for life insurance can basically last our entire life !'
      - 'I am sorry to hear about your financial difficulties . Before surrendering
        your Whole Life Policy please consider that you will no longer have coverage
        and if you were to apply in the future the cost will be more than what you
        are locked into now . That said , you may have some options available to you
        . First , have you considered just withdrawing or taking a loan from the cash
        value ? This way the policy will still be in force . Be sure to understand
        what the surrender value is as well on the policy . It may mean you will get
        less out of the policy than what you were thinking . Please consider what
        will happen if death was to occur in the next 5 years , 10 years , etc. and
        what financial situation this may put you in . I would recommend contacting
        your Broker/agent to discuss your options . If you do not have one , I would

      - To get life insurance on your mom , sit down with her and ask her what medications
        she takes , her height and weight , what health conditions she has had in
        the past and currently . Ask her what she wants to spend , or if you are the
        one who will be paying for it , ask her what amount she would like to see
        you get for her . It will seem less intimidating if she has a say in it .
        Then contact a website or agency for a quote . If you are getting it for final
        expense purposes , you will want to get a permanent policy . When getting
        life insurance on someone else , it is usually best to buy a No Exam policy
        , if you can . Your mom may have to do a phone interview to be approved .
        They will draft the first premium from your or your mom 's checking account
        when she is approved , and her policy will be in force .
      - 'What life insurance is the best depends on what purpose you want the life
        insurance for . The best way to answer your questions is to give an overview
        of the different types and then you can decide which one is best for you .
        Term insurance is the easiest to understand . You pay a specified premium
        for coverage for a specified term . Typical terms are 10 , 20 or 30 years
        . At the end of the term the policy renews at a higher premium for a new term
        until the policy expires . This type of coverage is temporary because the
        policy will expire at a specified time for example age 85 . Term policies
        are usually convertible to permanent insurance before before age 65 for example
        . Term insurance is best to provide the most coverage for a given premium
        today . Whole life insurance is as the name suggest permanent insurance with
        coverage for the whole of your life , It pays when you die not if you die
        before the policy expires . Whole life has a level premium and with some policies
        the premium can be paid up early for example 20 years or age 65 . The by-product
        of the level premium is a build up of cash value . If the policy is participating
        the build of cash can be even greater . Level premium , build up of cash ,
        increasing death benefit and hands off management make whole life a premium
        product . It is regarded by many as the best . Universal life is a permanent
        insurance policy that can be in force the whole of your life if it is managed
        properly . The good news is the premium is flexible and you have a choice
        how the cash reserve is invested , The bad news is that the premium is flexible
        and you have choice how the cash reserve is invested is flexible , Universal
        life can be the best if properly managed . An independent insurance broker
        , who represents several companies could help you find the right policy at
        the right price . If you have further questions , or feel that I could be
        of assistance , please do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like to
        work with a local life insurance broker , you could start with a Google search
        . For example , if you search for : life insurance broker Halifax or life
        insurance agent Halifax , my name , along with several others , will come
        up . You can use the same method to find a life insurance broker in your community
        .'
      - Interesting question . Makes me wonder if the above answers address what you
        meant to ask . So the points covered above are mostly what term life insurance
        does cover . What term life insurance does NOT cover is the risk of death
        after so many years as specified in the contract . Hence the `` Term '' In
        the name . Also term insurance ca n't be purchased for a person of 80 or the
        latest 85 years of age . Term insurance has no cash value so it does n't ``
        cover '' the need for a guaranteed tax-free growth of wealth like a Whole
        Life Insurance can . Term insurance ca n't `` cover '' the need for retirement
        income supplement like Whole Life can . As mentioned above no insurance including
        Term will cover suicide in the first two years of the policy . And of course
        also as mentioned above there is a contestability period with all life insurance
        to mitigate deliberate misinformation in order to obtain a policy . If fraud
        is proved on a claim within the contestability period the claim will be denied
        .
      - I am going to answer this question as someone who sells whole life and universal
        life only . I do not sell variable life insurance , which is typically considered
        an investment . First of all , I think the word `` investment '' does not
        really apply to life insurance , regardless of the type of product . This
        is because life insurance is first and foremost intended to provide a benefit
        to survivors . Any cash it develops is nice to have , but it is secondary
        . The first priority in buying life insurance should be getting the most attractive
        premium for the entire time you need coverage . Even with very aggressive
        underwriting , that cost can be higher than the costs associated with conventional
        investment products . Now , life insurance does have specific tax advantages
        . These include tax-deferred cash accumulation , and income-tax free benefits
        . You should speak with your tax advisor for more details . If the insured
        is young enough , and qualifies for a low enough rate , and is in a high-enough
        tax bracket , then the cost of his life insurance might be lower than the
        taxes he would pay on an investment outside life insurance . Here life insurance
        may be considered a smart `` investment . '' In most other cases , life insurance
        would not be a smart investment . But , with a strong product from a strong
        company , the guaranteed cash value in a whole life or universal life product
        could be significant . You could get more bang for your buck inside life insurance
        that you would from a standard conservative investment . For that reason ,
        people do use life insurance as the guaranteed or conservative part of their
        financial portfolio .
      - Each carrier that offers health insurance has a plan which includes such things
        as ; 1 -RRB- Benefits - what they will and will not cover 2 -RRB- Deductible
        - what you will need to pay before the benefits kick in 3 -RRB- Co Insurance
        - what portion you will be responsible for outside of the benefits you receive
        from the insurer 4 -RRB- Cost - how much the policy will cost you on a monthly
        , quarterly or annual basis There are a lot of factors involved in choosing
        an insurance policy that is best for you and your family . Contact a Health
        Agent and discuss your needs , budget and what you want in a policy . You
        can also access online sites to put in your info and get a quote .
      - 'In Canada , if the owner of the policy dies . what happens to the ownership
        of the policy depends on what the owner had put in place prior to his/her
        death . If the owner has named a contingent owner the the policy would transfer
        that way . If their was no contingent owner the the ownership would form part
        of the estate and be probated . Depending on who the policy ownership was
        transferred to there could be tax consequences . The cash value is what could
        be surrendered , the death benefit is not paid until the life insured ''s
        death . NOTE , once the policy has been issued the life insured has no claim
        on the policy or its cash value , unless the owner gave them the access .
        If you have further questions , or feel that I could be of assistance , please
        do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like to work with a local life
        insurance broker , you could start with a Google search . For example , if
        you search for : life insurance broker Halifax or life insurance agent Halifax
        , my name , along with several others , will come up . You can use the same
        method to find a life insurance broker in your community .'
      - There is no one best life insurance policy in the USA . That is like asking
        what is the best car in the USA . The type of life insurance -LRB- or car
        -RRB- that people buy depends on their budget , what they are using it for
        , what company they like , and whether they want to keep it for a long time
        or trade it off in the near future . A good life insurance agent will gather
        your personal health details , financial information , and desires , and find
        the best policy for you as an individual person .
      - In order to see what a competitive life insurance policy would cost for you
        , you can go to any number of websites that offer instant life insurance quotes
        and put in your date of birth , height , weight , and whether you use tobacco
        . Unless the website also asks about health conditions , it will only show
        the rates for people with excellent health , and these may be much lower than
        what you need to pay . But it does give you an idea what life insurance should
        cost for a segment of the population .
      - The question is too broad and its never good to give false hope in securing
        life insurance when you have cancer . But what kind of cancer do you have
        ? What stage of cancer is it ? What medical regiment or surgery has taken
        place or has been recommended and not taken place . Life insurance underwriting
        has become more benevolent regarding certain cancers over the last decade
        . Age also can be a factor if the final underwriting offer . Some cancers
        can be issued standard . Recent bouts of late stage cancer can be declined
        . Keep in mind that there are recognized impaired risk life insurance companies
        that seem to specialize in substandard business .
      - What is the primary purpose of life insurance ? What everthe policy owner
        wants it to be . Every purpose can be different . While dating myself a little
        bit by saying this . . Life insurance is the silly putty of financial products
        . It is a product that has many forms and can be used in many ways . One person
        's primary purpose may be someone else 's 5th choice . It 's not unheard of
        to start a first time client meeting with the question `` what do you want
        your life insurance to do ? ''

      - Getting life insurance with mental illness is a very broad category and the
        premiums can range from the top Preferred category -LRB- for mild depression
        -RRB- to being uninsurable -LRB- for a younger adult who is institutionalized
        due to mental illness , upon which there are no guaranteed issue options that
        I am aware of due to age -RRB- . A simple rule of thumb for medically underwritten
        life insurance for mental illness of any type is , can the person with mental
        illness hold down a steady full time job . If the mental illness is so well
        controlled by medication or therapy as to make that possible , or there is
        no need of treatment in order to live a normal life , then usually that person
        can obtain a medically underwritten life insurance policy . If someone is
        on Disability for the express purpose of mental illness , simplified and guaranteed
        issue plans are available . Of course , other factors come into play in deciding
        what type of policy the person with mental illness can get , and finding his/her
        best price . There include whether there has been a hospitalization for mental
        illness , suicidal thoughts or attempt , multiple medications needed for one
        diagnosis , etc. . But the vast majority of persons with mental illness can
        get life insurance .
      - If the mental illness is a pre-existing condition , a new Disability Insurance
        policy might not cover it . If you got the Disability Insurance before being
        diagnosed with the mental illness , check your policy 's wording to see if
        it covers disability due to mental illness . If a group policy , most limit
        Disability benefits for mental illness to a duration of two years .

      - Yes you can . It depends on the mental illness , medications , and medical
        history what type of policy you need to go with . Worse case you can go with
        a guaranteed issue plan . There are some simplified issue plans that may fit
        or if the problem is mild you may even be able to get a fully underwritten
        plan . You need to sit down with an experienced independent agent who can
        evaluate the details of your case and help you find the best plan for you
        . It would also be a good idea to have a trusted friend or relative present
        if your mental illness impedes your judgement in any way .
      - If your health insurance policy is not a grandfathered plan put in place before
        the Affordable Care Act -LRB- ACA -RRB- provisions went into effect and certainly
        if you have enrolled in a major medical policy after January 1 , 2014 then
        the answer is `` Yes '' . Under the ACA law health insurance plans must treat
        mental health and substance abuse problems as any other illness . In addition
        , there are now provisions for preventive care services in relation to some
        mental illnesses , depression screening and behavioral assessments for example
        , that must be covered at no cost to the member . A policy holder should carefully
        examine the provisions of their own policy or call their insurance carrier
        's member services department to verify what services are covered , where
        they are covered and what coverage provisions of your contract your needed
        services are subject to . For example , if you are an individual who enrolled
        in a Bronze level plan and youneed mental health services that are not preventive
        in nature but are for actual treatment then it is a virtual certainty that
        these services will be subject to your plan 's deductible and/or co-insurance
        provisions before you begin to see the insurance carrier paying for these
        services . In many cases this could be an amount in excess of $ 6000 before
        you would cease paying out-of-pocket for any services . Also , verify which
        mental health/behavioral health providers and facilities are in-network with
        your provider and determine if you have to be pre-certified to see any of
        these providers before you seek care in a non-emergency situation .
      - Golden Rule is a subsidiary of United Healthcare . Golden Rule issues individual
        major medical plans in select states . Most of the policies do include mental
        health benefits as required by your state department of insurance . In some
        cases you may `` buy up '' from the standard mental health benefit to an enhanced
        plan . The enhanced plan , where offered , replaces the usual limited benefit
        mental health benefit with one that treats mental health as `` any other illness
        '' .
      - Since mental illness covers such a broad range and level of diagnoses and
        symptoms , that is hard to answer with a general answer . Most companies will
        cover mild , controlled depression . On the other extreme , an adult institutionalized
        due to severe MR/ID may need to take a guaranteed issue policy , when old
        enough to qualify for it . To find out which company will have the lowest
        price for the person you have in mind , visit a website that specializes in
        impaired risk and share the details about this person -LRB- age , diagnoses
        , treatment , etc -RRB- . For an agent who knows what they are doing , it
        wo n't take them long to find the best company for someone suffering from
        mental illness .
      - That is a great question ! The Affordable Care Act -LRB- Obamacare -RRB- has
        as one of its provisions the mandatory inclusion of mental health coverage
        . It makes things like depression screenings , and substance abuse treatments
        available , along with many other services . It also keeps insurers from using
        mental health issues as pre-existing conditions and denying you coverage .
        Regardless of how you feel politically about the Affordable Care Act , to
        those with mental health issues , it has been a blessing . The policies offered
        under the Government exchange -LRB- www.healthcare.gov -RRB- are required
        to cover at least some mental health care treatments . I hope that helps ,
        thanks for asking !

      - Critical Illness Insurance and Life Insurance are two separate products .
        Critical Illness Insurance provides a benefit while the insured person is
        still alive but diagnosed with cancer , stroke , or other covered illness
        . Life Insurance pays a death benefit to the insured person 's beneficiary
        after having passed away from illness , accident , or any cause . Some Life
        Insurance policies do have Critical Illness benefits built in or added on
        as a rider . With these policies , you can access some of the face amount
        while still alive if diagnosed with a covered critical illness . If that benefit
        is never used , the entire face amount is paid out upon the death of the Insured
        .
      - If someone has a terminal illness at the time of applying for life insurance
        , there are a handful of guaranteed issue policies that will provide that
        person with coverage . However , this type of policy usually has a minimum
        age limit of 40 + , is for small face amounts -LRB- usually under $ 25,000
        -RRB- and not all states offer them . In addition , this type of policy is
        graded and will not pay out the full face amount for death due to illness
        until 2 + years have passed . If someone has life insurance and then is diagnosed
        with a terminal illness , and if the life insurance application/interview
        was done truthfully , then the policy will pay for death due to that illness
        , even if it occurs shortly after the policy was taken out . Some policies
        even offer a rider that allows the terminally ill person to take part of the
        death benefit in cash prior to death .
      - Critical illness is a specialized form of what used to be called `` dread
        disease '' coverage . More comprehensive than a simple cancer plan , critical
        illness policies normally pay a lump sum benefit on first diagnosis of listed
        medical conditions including heart attack , cancer , stroke and another 3
        - 7 named conditions . Most carriers do not issue critical illness after age
        65 or 70 . Buy a health insurance plan , not a life plan with a critical illness
        rider .
      - 'NOW ... hehehe . You ca n''t get DI soon enough . Yet the question can be
        changed to , `` Will I qualify for DI & should I consider additional options
        ? '''' Will you qualify >> Di underwriting is pretty messy . Where you work
        , how long you ''ve been there , what you DO , what you make , your health
        , your lifestyle , & much more will determine the carrier you should apply
        with , what benefit length & amount you ''ll receive , & what `` health tier
        '''' you ''ll receive . Although there is a LOT to gather for a disability
        quote , an experience , independent agent should make it a smooth process
        . I Might just know one ! Additional Options >> > simply said , the reason
        for buying a DI plan is to replace lost income if you are not able to work
        . Yet allow me to point out a issues that stump the DI process : What if you
        do n''t `` earn an income ? Such as a stay at home parent . Maybe you just
        entered the work force or started a completely different career & you have
        no `` income history '''' . Lower income earners face the challenge that most
        DI plans only replace up to 60 % of their income while out on a claim . They
        ''re already having a rough time making ends meet ... & now the income is
        down 40 % ??? OUCH . `` So Gravy . What can we do in addition to or instead
        of DI ? '''' ... Great question . Thanks for asking :--RRB- DI is a great
        foundation for anyone who earns an income . Yet consider other protection
        plans in addition to , or instead of , a standalone DI Plan . > Critical Illness
        : Receive a single payment of $ 5,000 , $ 10,000 , $ 50,000 , or as much as
        $ 500,000 upon DIAGNOSIS of a specified disease or condition . Fantastic protection
        for everyone ... Yet in this post , Low/No income wage earners should definitely
        consider this . > Hybrid / Living Benefits Life insurance : There are various
        life products that have either rides or acceleration of benefits for Disability
        & / or Critical Illness . As an example , I have a client that is young ,
        modest income , & decided that a single plan with life , disability , & critical
        illness benefits . She ''s hedged her bets with a single policy that covers
        multiple areas . When to buy & what is the best disability plan ??? Your specific
        situation will determine that . When you speak to an agent , I hope ALL your
        options are discussed .'
      - In past years , coverage for psychiatry varied dramatically depending on the
        state you live in and the policy you have . The passage of the Affordable
        Care Act was perhaps the largest expansion of mental health and substance
        coverage in decades , as all health insurance plans are now required to cover
        mental health and substance use disorder services . However , policies are
        allowed to place limits on the number of visits you receive each year , or
        on which pyschiatrist you use , so allows make sure to consult your insurance
        agent or company before seeking treatments .
      - Yes , most disability insurance policies pay claims for mental disorders .
        However , often times the benefit period for mental disorders is capped at
        24 months except in the state of Vermont where limitations are not allowed
        . If the benefit is capped , then the benefits will cease once the insured
        has been paid benefits for the specified period of time -LRB- again usually
        24 months -RRB- . There are some carriers that do not cap -LRB- restrict -RRB-
        this benefit .
      - You will only need long term care insurance if you are unable to take care
        of yourself at some point in your life . This can be due to illness , physical
        limitations , or loss of mental functioning . If you do not have long term
        care insurance , you will need to pay for your care another way . Medicare
        may pay for some of it at the start , and Medicaid can pay for it after your
        resources have been depleted . If you have long term care insurance , the
        policy will pay for those services after the elimination period you chose
        has passed , and for as long as you set the policy up to pay them .
      - 'Term Life can be issued for 10-30 years and provides a death benefit to the
        beneficiary . The policy expires at the end of the term and does not cover
        living after that point . Most policies will also pay a portion of the death
        benefit in advance if diagnosed with a terminal illness and less than 12-24
        months life expectancy . New Living Benefit Life policies also include no
        cost riders that will accelerate up to 90 % of the death benefit in case of
        Critical Illness -LRB- Cancer , Heart Attack , Stroke , Major Organ Transplant
        , etc. -RRB- ; Chronic Illness ; Disability ; Terminal Illness ; or Death
        . Funds can be used for any purpose , such as : medical bills , lost income
        , mortgage payments , household expenses , long term care , etc. . Living
        Benefit Term or Permanent Life policies are only available from approximately
        6 carriers .'
      - Can you get life insurance if you are ill ? That is a very good question .
        We tend to think of those who have serious diseases as most unlikely to get
        life insurance . But in reality , those who are undergoing testing for an
        -LRB- as yet -RRB- undiagnosed illness , those who are in the beginning stages
        of treatment for a newly diagnosed illness , or those who are awaiting surgery
        or treatment , are likely to be postponed until their illness is diagnosed
        or showing stable control . Once the health condition has been under control
        for a while , they will have a much easier time finding a life insurance policy
        that will cover them . The length of time that stability must be shown depends
        on the illness . For blood pressure or diabetes , 3 to 6 months of control
        is sufficient with some companies . For MS , most companies like to see at
        least a year of stability , although coverage can be obtained shortly after
        diagnosis . Cancer is usually postponed until a year of remission or more
        . Many people first consider applying for life insurance when they become
        ill . Contact a good impaired risk agency with lots of choices to find something
        you can get now and/or for the future .

      - New York Life provides options for exactly this situation . Say you do not
        want to pay premiums the rest of your life . Or say you want to give a gift
        to your grandchildren . This is exactly why New York Life , America 's oldest
        , largest , and highest rated life insurance company , created Custom Whole
        Life . With New York Life 's Custom Whole Life , you can arrange to pay premiums
        for a fixed number of years , to continue your policy , or the policy of whomever
        you are gifting it to , say your grandchildren . After that fixed number of
        year , the entire Life Insurance Policy will have been paid in full , and
        paid with a reduced amount of premium dollars ! How does New York Life do
        this ? The sooner they have the money , the quicker it can be invested by
        New York Life , building growth and compounding the interest . Yes , the premium
        for those first few years will be higher than under regular whole life , but
        it will quickly disappear completely and the policy will be paid in fully
        , requiring no further premium payments ever from anyone ! This sounds like
        exactly what you are looking for .
      - This really is a critical question . But let 's ask it in reverse to cut to
        the chase . Which life insurance company denies the fewest claims ? That 's
        what you really want to know , right ? The Life Insurance Company that denies
        the fewest claims , and always resolves gray areas in favor of the insured
        and their claim , is New York Life . They also are the Life Insurance Company
        that pays claims the very fastest , usually within one week . I check the
        daily reports and see just how much is paid out every single day by New York
        Life . They brag about their quick payment on claims and about not fighting
        on claims when there is a possible basis to pay . They is one reason New York
        Life has the very highest ratings , along with its highest financial ratings
        . You should talk with an experienced agent to make a decision . Remember
        though that New York Life policies are ONLY sold by New York Life Agents ,
        so do not expect anyone else to recommend them . They simply can not sell
        them . Love to hear fromyou.Gary Lane , Registered Representative and Agent

      - How much does a New York Life agent make ? Well it goes from zero to millions
        , depending on the agent . New York Life is a commission based company that
        pays agents for completed transactions in insurance and equity investments
        . Since the company is based in New York all commission payments are based
        on the State of New York 's restrictions on commissions . So in many cases
        this means the New York Life agent makes less upfront on sales than other
        agents . Commission payments tend to be stretched out over time with the policy
        .
      - I ca n't tell from your questionif your coverage is on an individual policy
        with AETNA or a group policy , that might have some bearing on the answer
        . If you are on a group policy it is possible that you could continue your
        current plan for sometime under the provisions of the COBRA law . If you are
        covered under an individual AETNA policy then there will almost certainly
        be issues . You will need to check with AETNA 's customer service unit to
        be sure about what the portability provisions are on your policy , but my
        take on the individual situation is that health insurance , especially individual
        health insurance , is regulated at the state level . AETNA is available in
        the individual marketplaces of both New York and Arizona . But , an AETNA
        policy approved in New York may not be the same as an AETNA policy approved
        for sale in Arizona . The ratesand network will also almost certainly change
        . So , taking your New York policy with you may not be simple or even possible
        . New York has a reputation for doing things their own way and this is especially
        true in the insurance business . You can certainly stay with AETNA when you
        move to Arizona but I would anticipate that they will want to enroll you in
        an AETNA individual policy approved for residents of Arizona that will then
        also be an ObamaCare compliant plan . With relocation out of state being involved
        , I think it is unlikely you will be able to continue your grandfathered plan
        -LRB- I hope I 'm wrong for your sake -RRB- . A move like yours is explicitly
        listed in the Affordable Care Act as one of the `` change of life status ''
        events that qualifies you to enroll in ObamaCare outside of open enrollment
        . You 'll have 60-days to enroll from the date your existing coverage might
        cease .
      - To buy life insurance in New York , you can go to a website that offers it
        , look through your Yellow Pages and call an agency , or ask friends , relatives
        or co-workers for a referral . When purchasing online , you can use the quote
        engines and put in New York to see if they offer policies there . New York
        has its own companies so not every agency does business there .
      - Matt is correct . New York Life is an independent national insurance company
        . We are a mutual company , meaning our policy holders own our company , and
        we are not beholden to Stock Holders , so we can have lower rates and better
        service . In addition to Term Policies , we offer our flagship Whole Life
        Policies , along with Long Term Care Insurance , Annuities , Pension Replacements
        , College Funding , a variety of Retirement Plans . For details , call a New

      - Car insurance rates in New York are determined by many variables . Some of
        the most important factors are your driving record -LRB- including other family
        members -RRB- , your zip code or county , your age , the type of vehicle you
        drive , your credit history , how the vehicle is used and the types of coverage
        you carry . Additionally , the company you are insured with plays a big role
        in determining the rates . So ... how do you get a free quote for car insurance
        in New York ? A reputable nationwide -LRB- or New York based -RRB- car insurance
        website will zoom -LRB- pun intended -RRB- you to your destination . Typically
        , you can compare the best offers and get expert advice at no cost .
      - Guardian Life Insurance Company of America is a mutual company based in New
        York City , New York . They also have regional offices all across the northern
        states , from Washington to New York . Rated A + + by AM Best , Guardian Life
        Insurance Company has several subsidiaries , including Berkshire Life Insurance
        Company of America .
      - Since you 're asking where to buy life insurance I 'm guessing you do n't
        have an insurance adviser that you work with . So my first suggestion is to
        locate an insurance adviser in your area . Try an internet search or the phone
        book . When you interview advisers find out if they are able to sell policies
        from a number of insurance providers or only one . Find out which Mutual Insurance
        companies they work with . Mass Mutual , New York Life and Guardian are the
        strongest , and in my experience Mass Mutual is the best because they put
        the client 's interests above their own . So if you ca n't find an Insurance
        Adviser/Broker , call your local Mass Mutual agency .
      - The beneficiary makes the decision on how to spend the proceeds of life insurance
        . If you wish , you can make your funeral home the beneficiary of your policy
        , as to the portion for the funeral expenses for you . The balance can be
        used by another beneficiary , as they see fit , if you wish to have a higher
        benefit amount . Gary Lane , Registered Representative , New York Life . 949 797 2424
        . Thank you .
      - Whole Life is NOT an investment . It is a protection , with many benefits
        . You can always risk your money in stocks or bonds . But if you want it to
        be safe and be guaranteed to grow , you need whole life insurance . It never
        decreases , and the premiums never change -LRB- you can even prepay them for
        life and later pay nothing -RRB- and the appreciation of a policy with New
        York Life can even pay the premium later , or lend you the money for college
        , a new home , or your retirement , tax free .
      - New York State has very strict regulations for life insurance agents and companies
        regarding replacement of a life insurance policy . Commonly referred to as
        `` Reg . 60 '' due to the section of the life insurance code dealing with
        replacements , it mandates that agents follow a strict disclosure process
        anytime they are recommending someone change or replace their existing life
        insurance policy . The disclosure process is even required if the agent has
        any reason to believe that the sale may impact an existing policy , even if
        he is not making that recommendation . While the regulation can be onerous
        on the agent and the replacing company , it helps to protect the insured .
        The agent has to provide a side-by-side comparison of the new policy to the
        the existing policy and disclose all potential disadvantages to replacing
        the policy .
      - In simple terms , a COBRA health insurance is a short-term continuation of
        the exact same group health plan you had with your employer prior to termination
        from that job . So , if you liked the coverage provided by the plan prior
        to termination , you will still like the coverage provided by the plan under
        COBRA administration because it is the same plan . What you may not like is
        the cost under COBRA administration . Many people incorrectly assume that
        COBRA rates are excessively higher than the rates you paid while employed
        . This is incorrect . By law , your insurance rates under COBRA can not exceed
        102 % of the rate you were paying before termination . So , why does the COBRA
        premium seem so much higher than the premium prior to termination ? The answer
        is your employer 's contribution to your health insurance . While you were
        employed , your employer was definitely paying a portion of yours , the employee
        's , health insurance premium . If you worked for a `` benefits rich '' employer
        , they may have been paying all your premium and even contributing some to
        your dependents ' coverage . Under COBRA , the employer no longer is responsible
        to contribute anything to your health insurance premium . You are therefore
        responsible for 100 % of your portion of the premium as well as that of your
        dependents . That is why the COBRA cost is more than you were seeing while
        employed . So , the real question then becomes is it cheaper for me to continue
        with my current group health plan under COBRA , or is there a better alternative
        in the personal health insurance marketplace . The only way to answer that
        question is to solicit quotes from personal health insurers .
      - Assuming this is n't a Workers Compensation claim but an individual or group
        medical insurance claim then the torch has been passed to your new insurance
        plan on the date your coverage went into effect with them . If it is an ObamaCare
        compliant plan then it must cover any pre-existing condition immediately with
        no exclusions or waiting periods . If you are on a group major medical plan
        you will want to get a deductible credit form from your new insurance carrier
        and a deductible report from your previous insurance carrier and submit this
        to your new insurance carrier so that any amounts you have met towards your
        deductible in 2014 under your previous carrier will be credited against your
        deductible under your new plan for the remainder of 2014 -LRB- most health
        insurance plans track your deductible on a calendar basis regardless of what
        your company 's contract year basis is or your start date is -RRB- . Otherwise
        you will find yourself starting over with a brand new deductible exposure
        and if any or all of the treatment you are scheduled to receive is subject
        to your plan 's deductible you may find yourself on the hook for a lot of
        extra expense . The big issue when you are moving from one insurance carrier
        to another in the midst of treatment like you are describing is making sure
        that your health care providers are in-network providers with your new insurance
        plan and also making sure that there are n't any pre-certification or referral
        requirements that you have to comply with under your new plan . This is an
        area I 've seen a lot of people get caught up in the insurance bureaucracy
        and ending up incurring higher out-of-pocket expenses than might have otherwise
        been the case . So , while I know you probably do n't feel like dealing with
        these issues at this time , you would be wise to investigate them before proceeding
        with any further treatment .
      - When states try to be unusually restrictive they often penalize the insurance
        consumers in that state . For example , a few states do n't allow different
        rates based on gender . When that happens , most life insurance companies
        simply charge females the male rates . It penalizes the females around 20
        % compared to what they pay in other states . New York 's restrictive requirement
        on insurance companies raises a lot of money for the state but greatly limits
        the consumer choices to just a few . Many products are not available to them
        that they could buy if they moved to any other state . Kentucky 's law about
        no new contestable period on replacement policies does protect consumers but
        it also causes some companies to choose not to offer products in that state
        . State insurance laws can be a double edged sword .
      - I could tell you the Christmas story . About how a father or mother bought
        life insurance to protect their spouse and their children , if there were
        to be gone from them . About how the life insurance would protect their family
        from having to find a way to pay the mortgage or having to sell the house
        and move from the local school , or maybe mom having to get a new job . But
        the most important part about having life insurance is just knowing that your
        loved ones are protected should you no longer be with them . Finding the right
        agent to listen to you and find out what you need , and having the best company
        , one that pays claims quickly , will give you a sense of relief and satisfaction
        . That 's what having life insurance is all about . Gary Lane , Registered
        Representative , New York Life , 949 797 2424 . Thank you .
      - What 3 questions does AARP ask for life insurance ? I guess the answer to
        this question would best be found on AARP 's website for life insurance .
        I think it might be more important to look at the insurance offered with those
        3 questions . Currently it is a group policy offered through New York Life
        . NYL is a fine company so no worries there . This plan is a 5 year level
        term policy , which means every five years the cost will increase . The policy
        ends at age 80 , with nothing to convert over to . So if you need coverage
        beyond age 80 , you will be shopping again . Pricing wise , because of the
        few questions asked , the price tends to be high . This would be true of any
        insurance company that asks only a few questions . What you do n't ask about
        , you charge for . So a healthy person could do much better elsewhere , but
        for the person who wants to go this route and does n't mind the extra cost
        and the early ending , it 's fine .
      - The vast majority of folks with term , do not keep it to the end of the term
        but let it lapse . Thus you find yourself starting to look all over again
        . If you can not yet afford Whole , I suggest you start with term for 10 years
        and then convert with a company you trust . The older you get the harder and
        more expensive it becomes . New York Life has just announced a reduction in
        price in its 10 year level term policies , which can convert to Whole Life
        .

      - I have heard it said that the top life insurance sales people make more money
        than the top sales people in other industries . This could be true , because
        large commissions can run it to the millions of dollars . The life insurance
        business is an ideal environment for making it big . We sell a product that
        pays well . We represent strong and well established manufactures of this
        product -LRB- policies -RRB- . We dont have to maintain an inventory . We
        can develop sales organizations that dont require much labor or overhead .
        The demand for our services remains constant throughout the ups and downs
        of the economy . Of course , we have to pay our dues big time . We have to
        constantly strive to master our field and enhance our professional skills
        . We have to market , market , market , and then market some more . And we
        have to invest in every client prior to getting paid . To provide superior
        service , we need to provide a quote for a rate about which we are confident
        they will be approved . That can take many hours of work . And remember that
        life insurance has the most sophisticated and complicated set of eligibility
        requirements of all financial products . But at the end of the day we know
        we do outstanding work , and so we earn outstanding pay .
      - This debate has been going on for the last century . In theory , how could
        anyone be opposed to everyone having health insurance ? And , in theory ,
        if everyone was in the insurance risk pool this would be the best way to spread
        health care costs equally . By the same token , how could anyone be opposed
        to everyone having good and ample food & water , and everyone needs housing
        , and everyone needs utilities for their housing , and everyone needs transportation
        and there is a long list of other needs that we all have . The real question
        is can a society afford universal health insurance and thus universal health
        care in the sense that most Americans have become accustomed to getting it
        ? When you start looking at the economics of health care this becomes much
        more problematic . Health care is different from most services we consume
        in that it creates its own growing demand . Who does n't want to live longer
        , and live healthier during that longer life ? And , as you have probably
        noticed , we have a continually growing list of parts we can replace , once
        deadly illnesses we can now manage or cure , and treatments that just improve
        your `` quality of life '' . All this comes with a price tag and the price
        just keeps going up . I was born in 1957 for a cost of $ 400 , my son was
        born in 1987 for a cost of $ 4000 , and today a normal childbirth is easily
        $ 8000 + . As best as I can tell , babies are born the same way today as they
        were in 1957 but the cost has far outpaced general inflation levels in the
        economy as a whole over that time period . The painful reality is that providing
        universal healthcare in a modern society -LRB- e , g , - North America , Europe
        -RRB- has not been accomplished without rationing of healthcare services -LRB-
        however it might be disguised -RRB- . For instance , we have more MRI scanners
        in Memphis , TN than in all of Canada -LRB- a nation often cited as an example
        of where universal health insurance is a success -RRB- . Tests that get ordered
        and conducted on the same day here can have waiting times of months up there
        . There really is no definitive answer to your question . But it does highlight
        the gap between theory and reality when trying to address providing health
        insurance to a population .
      - When youre asking what insurance do you need when you retire , we need to
        know if youre asking about Health Insurance or are you talking about protecting
        your family from loss . If your question pertains to your health insurance
        because most of us loose that when we retire then you have two options . You
        can look at either a Medicare Supplement , which works similar to car insurance
        and what I mean by that is you can buy a plan with no deductible and pay a
        higher premium , that will cover all of your doctor and hospital expenses
        or you can assume part of the risk and pay a lower monthly premium with a
        deductible or co-pay and it will still cover your doctor and hospital expenses
        . Medicare Supplement will run you anywhere from $ 155 to $ 200 per month
        so around 2-3 thousand dollar per year to see your doctor 4 to 5 times a year
        . Some people like this option because their monthly cost is set even when
        they have a bad health year . The other option you have is to look at a Medicare
        Advantage plan if its available in your area . Most plans have either low
        or no monthly premium and small co-pays when you see your doctor or are hospitalized
        . All plans have a maximum out of pocket to protect you for bad health years
        so if youre like the average senior and you see your doctor the 4-5 times
        a year , your health insurance cost will run you under $ 100 . If you were
        asking about insurance to protect your family from loss then the answer get
        more complicated because we have to look at what insurance you already have
        in place , if you have a pension are you looking at taking a full or partial
        , do you have a 401K , if married when is your spouse going to retire and
        if it would be better to take their social security now or wait . With out
        knowing the answers to some of those questions answering that question would
        just be a blind shot in the dark .
      - 'Boy , what a question . For me , it gets to the root of what is wrong with
        government these days . Im going to speak bluntly because I feel very strongly
        about this issue . Even though I sell life insurance for a living , I have
        had extensive experience in the medical insurance marketplace . I am also
        a consumer , and have to buy the product for myself and my family . And ,
        I am a patriotic American who wants to see our country run the way it should
        be . Everybody needs medical care . If the insurance marketplace is left to
        run by its own devices , the vast majority of people will end up with a product
        that they like , at a price they can afford . If a small minority of people
        end up without coverage for whatever reason , their needs can be easily addressed
        . This could take place with a government safety net , an innovation by private
        companies , or some combination of the above . Either way , everyone will
        be able to have some form of coverage so that the cost of getting medical
        attention could be kept affordable . Beyond making sure that healthcare products
        and services are safe and secure , I cant see why government invention would
        be needed at all to make this system work . Next point : nobody is entitled
        to medical insurance . Frankly , nobody is entitled to anything . A government
        should not be in the business of providing the stuff to which we think we
        are entitled . The whole notion of government taking care of you from cradle-to-grave
        is horribly misguided . A gargantuan state and federal bureaucracy can in
        no way give each and every man , woman and child the treatment they deserve
        every day of their life . Last point : giving this gargantuan bureaucracy
        the legal power to force you to do business with it is a travesty of justice
        . We have made a horrible mistake by giving the federal government the right
        to tax or penalize us when purchasing health insurance . We have let it get
        much too cozy with the corporate providers of healthcare . Who exactly is
        benefiting by this illicit partnership ? Is it you ? Is it me ? Do we actually
        have the health insurance we need at a price we can afford ? Many Americans
        do not . So the answer to your question is yes , the United States government
        can force you to buy health insurance , and we have nobody to blame but ourselves
        for this sorry state of affairs .'
      - Well , that is a great question ! As I think about it , I realize that I am
        5 people rolled into one . -LRB- Perhaps that is why my wife keeps asking
        me Just who do you think you are ?! :-RRB- We are hunters . We love to go
        out and find people with whom we can do business . We are personal coaches
        . We help our clients clarify their values and set priorities . We are field
        underwriters . We prepare people for going through the formal application
        process . We are advocates . We fight tooth and nail to get an approval at
        the rate quoted , and to solve any and all problems that emerge along the
        way . We are family friends . Processing life insurance claims is hard on
        everybody . A death in the family is tough to deal with . We are there for
        the beneficiaries in any way they need - on top of delivering a check to them
        .
      - 'Im going to answer your question this way : Im going to describe for you
        the kind of person who buys life insurance and is really glad they did . They
        are happy with the policy they bought ; they are happy with the process they
        went through to get that policy ; and they are happy to tell all their friends
        and neighbors about how happy they are with the purchase :-RRB- . These are
        the qualities of a happy life insurance shopper : Quality number one : the
        happy life insurance shopper dares to care . Look , life insurance is not
        for you , right ? Its for your beneficiaries . And frankly , some people could
        care less about what happens after they die . I mean , to put it bluntly ,
        they are dead , right ? Isnt that what it comes down to ? But for other people
        , the difference between being alive and being dead is not that great . I
        mean , you have spent a lifetime building something of value . Your marriage
        . Your family . Your business . Charitable causes worthy of your support .
        All these folks have become dependent on you . If you die , they could lose
        their economic foundation . But if you have insurance on your life , then
        they dont have to miss a dime . Life can go on in style for your spouse ,
        your children , your business partners , your employees , and all the needy
        people that are being helped by the charities you support . If you care about
        these people , then life insurance can make sure life goes on for them , even
        when your life does not go on for you . Quality number two : the happy life
        insurance shopper understands that the time to buy is now . Everyone knows
        we all die sometime . For most of us , though , death is something that happens
        to someone else - until it strikes home . Maybe someone close to us gets really
        sick , or we ourselves have a brush with death that wakes us up . But up to
        that point , we just dont want to think about it . We also convince ourselves
        that if we stay in shape , eat right , manage our stress , and maintain a
        good attitude , we can forestall the inevitable . The fact of the matter is
        that if we really thought about it , there are a whole slew of hazards that
        are entirely beyond our control . Heres a few that come to mind : Freak household
        accidents . Violent crime . Natural disasters . Car crashes . Of course we
        all say that odds are against any of these happening to us . We even say to
        ourselves that we can afford to wait and buy a policy next year or the year
        after , so we can qualify for a better rate . But in the meantime , things
        can happen . And they do . All the time . Unexpectedly . If your time comes
        before you have a policy in force , then your beneficiaries lose out . You
        really cant afford to die until that coverage is in place . Quality number
        three : the happy life insurance shopper wants a guaranteed return on his
        or her money . OK . Now you know you need to get coverage in force as soon
        as possible because you never know when your time will come . The next logical
        question is : for how long do you keep the coverage in force ? Easy answer
        : for as long as you live . You know at some point you will have your last
        day on this earth , so that means you know for sure your beneficiary will
        get their money when your time comes ... ... as long as the policy is still
        in force . That means you need permanent coverage . The policy should last
        as long as you do . Doesnt permanent coverage cost more then term coverage
        ? Yes . Isnt term good for short-term needs ? Yes . Can you buy term and then
        purchase permanent when you can afford it ? Yes . Does it make sense to buy
        term now and then convert to a permanent product ? Yes . The thing is , if
        you dont take a long-term strategy , then you wont be guaranteed a payout
        . If you do take a long-term strategy , then you will . Guaranteed by a top-flight
        financial institution . Quality number four : the happy life insurance shopper
        knows what hes getting into . When you buy a house , do you expect to write
        a check for the purchase price agreed on ? Of course you do . Same when you
        buy a business , book a cruise , and buy a pair of shoes . We even demand
        that a grocery store clerk honors the price on the shelf if an item has been
        mislabeled . Life insurance should operate the same way . Hard to believe
        , isnt it ? All too often , a broker will submit an application on the hope
        and prayer that the applicant will be approved at the rate quoted . We wont
        know what the price really will be until you are approved . Yes , right ,
        but if you go through full disclosure on a preliminary basis , you can become
        confident in what that price will be . The broker has to prequalify you and
        present carriers with thorough and accurate quote information upfront . They
        can then commit to a price , contingent upon information obtained in underwriting
        not contradicting the preliminary disclosures . You can then be sure of what
        you are buying . If you dont get prequalified , then you cant be sure . Simple
        as that . Quality number five : the happy life insurance shopper wants to
        be heard . There are a few companies out there who let consumers call them
        and buy policies . Thats nice for a tiny percentage of the zillions of men
        and women who need coverage . The rest of us need personalized service and
        a guide to walk us through the vast marketplace of potential carriers . Only
        one or two of them will be the best for us , and that broker has to lead the
        way to their doorstep . But life insurance distribution can be pretty rigid
        . The broker usually does not have direct access to the carriers . He or she
        must work through carrier general agencies who act as wholesalers of their
        products . So there is you , your broker , his or her general agent , and
        their carrier . I am sure you have played that telephone game where one person
        in the line passes down a message , and by the time it reaches the end , its
        completely different . Its the brokers job to make sure all information about
        you that is passed along the underwriting channels remains consistent and
        is fairly assessed . He or she is your advocate , and must be prepared to
        carry your cause over any and all hurdles that pop up in underwriting . And
        they do pop up . All the time . If you have been properly prequalified for
        coverage , then the bottom line is this : you should be approved at the rate
        quoted unless information arises in underwriting that is substantially different
        from the information that was disclosed on a preliminary basis . Your broker
        is your advocate to make sure that happens . In my humble opinion , this is
        how you buy life insurance . If you follow this path , you will be one happy
        camper :-RRB-'
      - I will start with conceding that eliminating the issue of people being unable
        to get health insurance due to pre-existing conditions and making coverage
        of maternity mandatory are essentially good things that corrected issues which
        were increasingly problematic for our society . The stated goals of Obamacare
        were to eliminate people being uninsured and to reduce the cost of health
        care and thus lower the cost of health insurance while simultaneously increasing
        the quality of care . By May of 2014 we can now begin to look back and factually
        state that ObamaCare has failed to accomplish any of these goals in any meaningful
        way . Four years of efforts and billions of dollars have resulted in less
        than a 4 % decrease in the number of uninsured Americans , still leaving 30
        + million uninsured . Healthcare costs have continued to rise and utilization
        rates have increased by 7.1 % in the first quarter of 2014 so we now have
        both higher unit costs and increased per capita consumption of health care
        services . This will translate into higher premium costs in 2015 . Changes
        in health plan benefit designs and provider networks necessitated by the need
        to comply with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act have some chronically
        ill citizens facing higher out of pocket expenses for their health care and
        losing access to their established physician and hospital relationships and
        disruption in their courses of treatment and access to certain prescriptions
        . As a transitional product , the government created a program called the
        Pre-Existing Conditions Insurance Plan -LRB- PCIP -RRB- . This plan provided
        comprehensive , subsidized major medical coverage to persons who were uninsurable
        due to pre-existing conditions . There was no underwriting , you just had
        to prove you were uninsurable and you were in . The benefits were consistent
        with if not superior to what many Americans had through their private individual
        health insurance or what they received through their jobs . If the objective
        was to provide quality , affordable health insurance for the uninsurable then
        properly funding and continuing this program would have been much more cost
        effective and less disruptive to society in general than the results we have
        seen to date from ObamaCare . Books have been written and will be written
        on the failures and shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act and they are too
        numerous to go into here . Of course , there are those who now have `` affordable
        '' health insurance because they are receiving subsidies . In practical economic
        terms though , how effective is any system that requires massive subsidization
        in order to function ? such an approach introduces inefficiencies from the
        bureaucracy required to administer it and is largely a transfer of wealth
        mechanism . Indeed , it creates a whole new set of problems for those too
        `` rich '' to qualify for subsidies but who now struggle or find themselves
        unable to afford the much higher premium costs of Obamacare compliant health
        plans . We take from the middle and upper middle class to subsidize the lower
        middle class and poor . All in a new system that the very politicians who
        created it have made sure that they and their families do not have to participate
        in . These are just some of the things that are wrong with Obamacare .
      - 'I have a bit of a different opinion about this . I believe most agents fail
        because they are n''t trained correctly . I ''ve been doing this since 1991
        and explored many company ''s training programs . In that time , I have n''t
        seen them change . Do you think the market has ? Insurance companies spend
        thousands of hours and millions of dollars training their agents on products
        , business plans , and sales skills . I ''ve consulted with new agents from
        some of the biggest companies in the country that were on the verge of failure
        . They did exactly what they were trained to do and they were failing miserably
        . These are some bright , knowledgeable sales professionals . You know what
        their companies told them to do ? Buy leads and call them , buy more leads
        and call them . If that does n''t work , you ''re not calling enough . Can
        you believe it ? When you find something that ''s not working enough , do
        it more . I believe that the reason agents fail is that they are n''t good
        prospectors . They ''ve never been trained in how to prospect or market themselves
        or their business . Try this , go to 10 agents , any age , any experience
        , and ask them what their biggest challenge is . I ''ve asked a lot more than
        that and I can tell you what the overwhelming answer is : `` I do n''t have
        enough prospects to sell to '''' . It ''s the same with everyone . If you
        find someone who says they have enough or too many , they ''re service providers
        , not agents . I watch really smart , professional salespeople struggle at
        the same time I look at a guy who looks awful , sounds worse , and does n''t
        know anything about insurance succeed almost effortlessly . You know the difference
        ? That last guy knows how to talk to people . Watch him , he ''s always talking
        to people and he actually listens to them and cares . Bottom line , the best
        prospectors are the most successful agents . As an industry , we have to begin
        training prospectors , not salespeople . We have to show new agents how to
        connect with more people and market themselves . We should spend more time
        training people on how to find new prospects than we do on how to sell to
        the prospects they do n''t have . I believe there ''s a shift coming from
        price driven , transactional selling back to a relationship based insurance
        practice . If we treat our products and services as a commodity , so will
        the consumer . So , let ''s take the first step and change the way we train
        new agents . Let ''s first find agents motivated by the profession , not the
        money -LRB- not that the money ''s bad -RRB- . Then , let ''s train them on
        finding good prospects . As I see it , that ''s the future of our profession
        and the companies and agencies that start doing this will be on the front
        of that wave while the rest try to figure out why their 50 year old training
        program is n''t working .'

      - 'Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain and nervous system involving repeated
        random seizures that occur without warning . If you have been diagnosed with
        epilepsy and are trying to purchase life insurance , the severity of the disease
        can have an effect on the rates you pay . Life insurance companies will want
        to know a number of factors to make an accurate risk assessment including
        : 1 . What age were you diagnosed with epilepsy ? 2 . Do you have Grand Mal
        , Petite , or Focal seizures ? 3 . When was your most recent seizure ? How

        so many people do n't have coverage , yes , many colleges do require it .
        The last number I saw was approximately 35-40 % of Colleges require health
        insurance coverage -LRB- ACHA 2008 study , if I remember correctly - I have
        kids in college -RRB- . That number may be higher by now . Having the requirement
        allows the school to lower their liability , and helps protect the student
        body . If you need insurance , please feel free to contact me , I 'd be happy
        to help . Thank you for asking !
      - Why buy private health insurance ? Well , honestly for a while longer you
        do n't have to if you do n't want to . The choice to insure has been a personal
        one in this country for some time . If you did not wish to have coverage ,
        you did n't have to carry any . But here 's the rub to deciding not to have
        health insurance . If you have a medical need and the means to come close
        to paying the BILL that comes along with treating the need , the BILL will
        be treated as any other BILL a person receives in their lifetime . That is
        , if you decide not to pay it and you have assets or the means to pay it ,
        the hospital or doctor will act just like any other entity out there and send
        you to collections for recovery . The people Hospitals and Doctors `` write
        off '' do not have the means to pay for a premium . They have nothing of value
        . So yes , they do get their care without charges . If you have the means
        to pay and do n't , a hospital or Doctor will not treat you the same way .
        Besides all insurance does is cover for risk you do not want to self insure
        for . You can either pay for an insurance policy or pay out of your assets
        , entirely for now , your choice .
      - It depends . What is your specific situation - how many vehicles do you have
        , how many drivers are in your household ? Do any drivers have any tickets
        or accidents in the last 3 years ? Do you own a home and/or have other assets

      - Trampolines are an attractive nuisance not unlike the pond on the back forty
        , They are the source of a lot of additional liability exposure to the policy
        and the homeowner . The biggest reason that liability increases is because
        more than one child or person is one the equipment at a time . Most families
        with a trampoline have n't established risk-based rules for use and enjoyment
        and so what looks to be a fun and exciting play thing , becomes a hazard teeming
        with potential to cause great bodily harm . Insurance companies know from
        experience that trampolines cause losses and are expensive to insure because
        the injuries can become catastrophic . Broken bones are one thing . A broken
        neck with paralysis is completely another but well within the outcomes on
        a trampoline . Add to the trampoline an almost complete lack of training or
        instruction on the correct methods of use -LRB- and the lack of appropriate
        rules for use -RRB- , and we find the trampoline becomes similar to a loaded
        gun just waiting for curious hands with just as much potential to destroy
        a healthful life . Another issue that crops us is the degradation of the platform
        fabric since it is exposed to weather and sunlight . People have been known
        to bust through the platform because it became degraded due to the sun and
        weather effects . Bones get broke hitting the found and frame members below
        the deck . In my experience , most companies do n't want anything to do with
        insuring a home with a trampoline . A relative few do n't charge additional
        premium and do n't restrict the presence of a trampoline . Others still will
        permit a trampoline when it is is present for coverage at an additional charge
        . One carrier we represent charges an additional $ 75 annually for the trampoline
        , requires the fences to be installed -LRB- most trampolines come with them
        -RRB- , and they wo n't provide insurance on the home unless the trampoline
        is also included in coverage . All in all , you do n't simply have the choice
        to not insure the trampoline since the mere act of having one dramatically
        increases the chances of having a loss ! That said , trampolines can be enjoyed
        safely but it requires careful and near constant monitoring by the responsible
        adults , the establishment of rules for use , the ability to protect the equipment
        from non-invited use by neighbors when the owner or their children are not
        using the equipment , and inspection periodically for signs of degradation
        and normal wear and tear . Additionally , basic skills should be discussed
        , taught and understood , limits should be placed on the behavior that is
        allowed on the trampoline , and responsible adults should be willing to stop
        all play when careful control can not be maintained . Many injuries occur
        when the parents are not paying attention or aware from the home . Let 's
        face it , no one wants to be sued for the liability that may arise out of
        an injury on a trampoline and no one wants to deal with the often catastrophic
        injuries that can occur to your children or the neighbors . These latter comments
        and insight are a good foundation for understanding why an insurance company
        does n't like trampolines and why homeowner insurance is often negatively
        influenced when they are present on the property .
      - No , life insurance rates are non-negotiable to the extent that you can not
        ask for a discount . Likewise , all agents must charge the same rates . When
        you see an agency advertising affordable rates , what we mean is that we can
        shop multiple companies to place you with the one that is most favorable for
        your health and age . When you see an agency broadcasting extremely low prices
        for life insurance , what they are doing is quoting the best rate for the
        shortest term . Most brokers have access to those same companies and rates
        , and applying with one agency over another will not cause you to qualify
        for a discount . What does matter in life insurance rates is matching up with
        an agency who understands your situation and can help your policy be placed
        at the best possible rate . This starts with putting your application with
        the right company , and it ends with seeing that policy through to the end
        . If your doctor has retired and moved to the Bahamas and no one can find
        the medical records required to get your policy approved , this agency will
        track them down or work with the underwriter to get you approved without them
        . If you are rated up due to an error on your MIB , they will help you get
        it corrected and go back for a lower rate . If your spouse loses their job
        and you can no longer afford the 30 year term policy you were approved for
        , they help you get the 10 year term until you are back on your feet . While
        insurance agents can not negotiate life insurance rates , we can be responsible
        and knowledgeable and help you get the lowest rates by simply doing our job
        correctly and thoroughly .
      - '`` Better '''' is a completely subjective term in this case . The question
        is really about covering your risk and whether that risk is temporary or permanent
        . Term insurance is usually used to offset a temporary risk such as a mortgage
        or other debt that has a specific term . Whole Life , and other types of permanent
        insurance , are generally used to cover risks that are ongoing with no expiration
        date , like your income or living expenses . When working with my clients
        , we spend more time identifying risks and classifying them as temporary or
        permanent , then assigning amounts to each . The we match the product to the
        risk and the budget . If cash flow is n''t an issue -LRB- which it usually
        is -RRB- , I recommend 100 % permanent insurance as it ''s the most cost effective
        over the long run . If you live long enough , the cash value in the policy
        will equal or surpass the premiums paid , effectively making your net outlay
        zero or better . What I usually find is that people do have a budget but still
        want to cover themselves properly and we end up covering the temporary risk
        with term insurance and the permanent risk with some type of permanent insurance
        , like whole life . The more important question is n''t which is better ,
        but how much is needed . Set up correctly , you could start out with mostly
        or all term insurance and convert it to permanent as your budget allows .
        Another factor to consider is age and insurability . The earlier in life you
        buy life insurance and the healthier you are , the less it will cost . In
        summary , the best insurance is the insurance you buy now , when you ''re
        younger and healthier . Find a good advisor and he/she will help you determine
        the amount and type which best fits your situation . Get insured first and
        lock in your insurability . You can always make changes in the future .'

        property on your renters policy , contact either your agent or the direct

        should understand that the claim might trigger an increase in future premiums

      - -- > Normal 0 In the spirit of every reasonable insurance question is deserving
        of an answer , I submit . Tenant Homeowner or Renters policies cover damage
        to your personal property and food certainly would be considered Personal
        Property . As long as the power outage was caused by one of the named perils
        in your policy -LRB- fire , lightning , wind , vehicle damage , etc. -RRB-
        and it occurred on your premises , you may have a valid claim for food spoiled
        as a result of a power outage . But if the power outage was caused by something
        that occurred away from your residence , most Renters policies specifically
        exclude that type of loss unless the power outage then causes covered damage
        to your residence . Remember however , most Renters policies have a deductible
        of $ 250 or more so make sure you take that into consideration . Add to that
        the effect submitting a small claim , one less than $ 1000 , could have on
        your future premium or the willingness of your insurance company to renew
        your coverage . It may be a good idea to pass on submitting this type of claim
        even though you may have some coverage . In addition , most policies require
        you to take reasonable steps to preserve your property following a loss .
        Make sure you have done what you can to prevent your food from spoiling following
        a power outage . Some policies include a number of additional coverages ,
        often an effort to make one companys policy appear more attractive than another
        . These additional coverages provide nominal amounts of insurance covering
        specific loss situations such as key replacement or food spoilage . Here again
        , you may be tempted to submit a claim because you have coverage but consider
        the impact a claim might have on future premiums and renewal terms . You may
        be better served to simply replace the food . When an event like this occurs
        , try to recall why you purchased insurance in the first place . More than
        likely , it wasnt to reimburse you if the food in your refrigerator went bad
        .
      - If I had to guess on how long it takes to receive a check on a renter 's loss
        , I would say a good average would be 30 days . Property insurance policies
        , like a `` Renter 's '' policy usually have an entire section -LRB- that
        no one reads -RRB- outlining what you as the insured must do following a loss
        . Generally you have the obligation to notify the insurer promptly and submit
        a written summary of the items that were lost or damaged , how and when they
        were acquired , the cost to repair or replace them and their current value.Some
        claim adjusters may help you in this process , but it is your responsibility
        and not much happens before it has been completed . Once this `` list '' is
        prepared AND accepted by the insurer , policies usually state how many days
        the insurer has to pay you . In practice , however , I would say checks are
        received within a week or two AFTER your proof of loss is ACCEPTED . I would
        however expect insurers to question the value certain items , request additional
        documentation or require proof of purchase on higher valued items . I would
        also caution insurance consumers to make sure these lists are accurate . Entire
        claims can be denied because lists -LRB- proofs of loss -RRB- contain information
        that is questioned and found to be false . Like I had a 52 inch HD TV when
        it was actually an 18 inch portable you bought at a tag sale . In a serious
        loss such as a fire or storm loss , insurers often advance partial payments
        to cover the replacement of necessities or temporary living expenses until
        the more formal claim process is completed .
      - Medicare is operated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -LRB-
        CMS -RRB- , which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services in
        cooperation with the Social Security Administration , it does not have a central
        claim-paying office for incoming claims . Rather , large insurance companies
        , chosen within each state , actually administer the claim payment process
        . So , from state to state , claim submissions are submitted to different
        entities . For example , claimants living in New Jersey submit claims to the
        New Jersey Medicare Claim Office .
      - There is really only 1 renters policy . However , the coverage included can
        vary . Some policies are written on an Actual Cash Value basis , where other
        policies are written on a Full Content Replacement basis . Let me explain
        the difference . Let 's say you went out and bought a brand new TV that cost
        you $ 1000 today . Three years from now , it gets damaged and you submit a
        claim under your Renters policy . On the Actual Cash Value policy , the claim
        adjuster would look up the make and model of your TV , and find that it is
        no longer selling for $ 1000 . That model now sells for $ 400 . But the $
        400 would be for a brand now unit out of the box , where your TV was 3 years
        old , so they further reduce the claim based on depreciation . You 're left
        with $ 250 - and you still need to pay your $ 100 deductible . Not a good
        day . With Full Contents Replacement coverage , the claims adjuster looks
        at how much you spent on the TV , not the make and model , and your claim
        is processed for $ 1000 -LRB- minus your $ 100 deductible -RRB- . And since
        technology has improved over the past three years , you now have the choice
        to purchase the same TV you had -LRB- which is selling for only $ 400 now
        remember ? -RRB- or purchase a better TV with better features than the one
        that was damaged . Not a bad day at all ! Although the Actual Cash Value policy
        will cost less , you wind up getting less in the end . Remember , just because
        one policy is cheaper than another , does n't mean it 's a better deal . Always
        consult with a licensed , professional insurance agent to help determine which
        policy is best for your needs .
      - Eyeglasses are personal property and the Renters Policy pays for personal
        property damaged by covered perils so in that sense , yes , eyeglasses are
        covered by the Renters Policy . They would also be covered by a Homeowner
        Policy and a Condo Policy . However , all those policies come with a deductible
        . A deductible is money you pay toward a claim . The insurance company pays
        the excess . Say , for example , it costs $ 300 to replace glasses that were
        damaged by a covered peril , like a fire . If you had a $ 250 deductible ,
        you would only recover $ 50 . I would suggest , you not submit the claim .
        Most insurance companies have a threshold of two claims in three years . After
        two claims in three years , your policy will not be renewed and because insurance
        companies share claim information , you will not get a competitive offer from
        any standard insurance company . You will end up paying much , much more money
        for the same coverage . My advice is to raise your deductible as high as you
        can tolerate and save your insurance for real disasters . Your question is
        important and I hope I 've answered it to your satisfaction . If not , feel
        free to call , fax or email me . Its no problem . I answer questions like
        this all the time . Kevin P. Foley , CPA , CPCU PFT&K Insurance Brokers T

      - It ultimately depends on how long it takes for you to submit a claim form
        -LRB- and any other documents your carrier requires -RRB- and the carrier
        to review and process the paperwork . If everything is in good order when
        you submit the paperwork , the entire process should take maybe a couple of
        weeks . If the carrier requests additional paperwork -LRB- e.g. something
        needs to be clarified -RRB- or the forms you submitted were not completed
        properly , then it could take a little longer than that . I hope the information
        is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your program

      - I suppose Medicare can accept paper claims but I am not aware of any providers
        that submit paper claims . All provider claims for several years have been
        submitted electronically . Any medical provider that treats a Medicare beneficiary
        is required to file claims with Medicare regardless of whether they accept
        assignment or not .
      - The funding source of paying disability claims depends on who is backing up
        the promise to do so . 1 . Social Security DI is funded by tax-payers 2 .
        State-sponsored DI -LRB- if available -RRB- is usually funded by employers
        within that state . -LRB- A sole-proprietor that constitutes a company of
        one person may be able to `` opt in '' to the program with special enrollment
        . -RRB- 3 . Individual - or corporate-owned DI is funded by an insurance company
        that collects premiums from the individual or corporation to form a `` pool
        '' of money from which claims are paid . In any of these cases , the funding
        source must have sufficient funds in the pool to pay out legitimate claims
        as they are submitted . Premiums reflect the justified cost of maintaining
        that fund at the proper level . Therefore , claims may require a company to
        submit an application to the State Department of Insurance for increasing
        premiumsfora specified `` block of business '' within which claims will -
        or already have - exceeded premiums coming in for that block . -LRB- An individual
        can not be singled out for premium increases . -RRB- If one owns a policy
        that is `` non-cancelable '' , that term means that the carrier can not increase
        premiums for any reason over the life of the policy .
      - How does a health insurance claim work ? Let 's follow a claim . First the
        billing is created in the doctor 's office where staff submits a claim for
        payment to an insurance company . This could be done anywhere from that day
        or later that month , depending on the office . I have known of providers
        who have sent collection notices before they 've even gotten around to billing
        . When the claim arrives at the insurance company it goes straight to the
        claims departement where the informaion is entered into the computers . Basically
        the claims person gets the bill , data entries the necessary information and
        hits enter . From that point on , most claims are untouched by human hands
        . The claim information goes into the computer where it is compared to the
        coverage the insured has . From that a payment and explaination of benefits
        page are created and sent on their ways . When I use the term untouched by
        human hands I mean not everything processed is checked to see if the parameters
        -LRB- plan design -RRB- are correct . Usually , only billings above a certain
        size are rechecked for accuracy . Years ago the threshold was 20,000 got a
        second look by a human for accuracy . Companies leave it up to the insured
        to find any small errors and call in for corrections . The cost of double
        checking every claim would be astronomical .
      - State life insurance commissioners monitor companies to ensure that life insurance
        proceeds are paid out in a timely manner . The beneficiary should receive
        the life insurance death benefit within two months of submitting the completed
        death claim and the insured person 's official death certificate to the life
        insurance company .
      - Asking how much renters insurance is with State Farm is like asking how much
        is a TV at Best Buy ? What size , what model and so on . How much renters
        insurance premiums are depend on how much personal property coverage , personal
        liability limits and medical not to mention your past insurance history and
        location which all play into the rates of renters insurance . This would be
        true of all insurance companies .

      - Most renters policies will cover a lost or stolen Iphone . However , after
        factoring in the deductible for your renters insurance and how an additional
        claim may affect your insurance rates , it may not be worthwhile to make that
        claim . Speak with your agent or broker to find out how this claim will affect
        you .

        will then get the full benefit . Within a week or so . You may have paid only
        a few hundred dollars , but the benefit could be in the millions . You may
        paid only a few thousand dollars , but the benefit could be in the tens of
        millions . That is a pretty good deal . Lets suppose your premium was $ 500
        a month , and your benefit was $ 5 million . That could happen , depending
        on age and other underwriting factors . If you decided to not purchase life
        insurance , how much money would you have to invest , at what interest rate
        , over what period of time , to accumulate $ 5 million ? The fact of the matter
        is that for the vast majority of people , they would end up spending much
        more money on that investment than they would on life insurance . So the real
        question is why is self-insurance so expensive ? How can buying a life insurance
        policy be so much cheaper than trying to fund your financial security out
        of your own resources ? And dont forget the big game-changing factor : we
        never know when our time will come . Dont assume time will be on your side
        so you could eventually collect the money to self-insure .'
      - You can get life insurance online or from a life insurance agency in your
        city . Some applications can be filled out with an agent , signed digitally
        , and go into effect within days . Others can be submitted by a paper application
        , have an exam done in your home , and may take several months for underwriting
        to be completed and the policy to go into effect . Having a helpful life insurance
        agent and case manager can make a big difference in how satisfactory your
        life insurance experience turns out .
      - Will health insurance pay for old bills ? It 's going to depend on how old
        ? Normally a insurance company allows anywhere from 6-12 months for a bill
        to be submitted and they will pay . Beyond that , they are no longer obligated
        to make a payment . If your medical provider has a problem with outgoing billing
        that they ca n't bill within a reasonable amount of time after your visit
        , it may be time to switch providers .
      - If you are injured as a result of a car accident , your health insurance will
        usually cover you at some point . In some states , the law provides that your
        car insurance include a required amount of `` No Fault '' primary medical
        coverage . In this case , the claim would have to be submitted to your auto
        insurance carrier first and once that benefit is exhausted , the balance can
        then be turned over to your medical insurance provider .
