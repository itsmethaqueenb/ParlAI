        result and of course there be those who try hide drug or nicotine usage so
        those 3 thing be the main thing a life insurance exam look for
      - the good answer to that question be right after the loss occur most policy
        require the insured notify the company at the time of loss or within a reasonable
        time thereafter the reason for this be if there be damage to the house structure

        this coverage any long because of several issue cash value life insurance
        be expensive when compare to other form of permanent life insurance the cash
        available borrow be non-existent in the early year and any amount borrow reduce
        the death benefit by that amount but perhaps the most negative from the owner

        the annuity contract be as good as the financial strength of the issuing annuity
        insurance company pay annuitization benefit or cash surrender the contract
        its important review the rating of the carrier and have your accountant review
        the carrier balance sheet
      - that be a great question those be really difficult policy and as a rule I
        do not recommend them so I can understand why you will want out of it there
        can be a whole lot of fee and opportunity lose money on these policy here
        be what I will advise you do get with your agent or a different 1 in the company
        or another trusted adviser and determine whether there be any salvageable
        cash value if there find out if it be good you reallocate your fund into safe
        subaccount run the policy dry , keep coverage as long as possible withdraw
        the cash let the policy lapse or roll it into something safe in a 1,035 move
        if there be no real cash value then drop it will be easy good luck and thanks
        for ask
      - how evaluate a long term disability plan it all come down to the definition
        of what disability the good policy use the fewest word define what disability
        the more word beyond that 1 sentence be really exception to the first sentence
        the definition shall be short and to the point that be where you start and
        actually finish your evaluation why because the rest of the information do
        not matter if you do not qualify or if your qualification end after a couple
        year
      - the fact this be your question be significant I often ask people take their
        picture and go to the internet where they can have the picture morphed age
        65 when they have the picture ask the picture what they shall do for retirement
        you be never too young begin save for retirement and if you be 30 there be
        an awfully good chance that you will spend almost half your life retire if
        you be work for a company that offer a retirement program that be the first
        place look what you be look for be the maximum amount that your employer will
        match of your contribution and what you must do get those matching fund this
        free money and be good regardless of other difficulty you may see with the
        plan at the same time check the vest schedule see if you will be able actually
        receive those benefit depend upon how long you reasonably expect work for
        the company since your company control all the investment that your retirement
        plan may have , you may want think twice before contribute more than the minimum
        require get the maximum matching fund it be worth note the company sponsor
        plan be probably cover under ERISA and that give you some guarantee you can
        not get elsewhere the whole financial world be out look for additional contribution
        that you may want make to your retirement my first advice be get a planner
        with whom you be comfortable some planner do not listen well and you really
        want 1 that will listen to your dream and aspiration the planner you want
        will communicate clearly with you and with any company that help manage your
        money it will be his job match your dream to your ability provide for those
        dream if your planner constantly boast about his advice and return on investment
        look for the exit high return on investment often go hand in hand with disastrous
        result the fundamental thing remember about retirement planning be return
        on investment be not the key issue the key issue be shift consumption when
        you move capital to your future you accomplish your mission fundamentally
        save for retirement be consume less now so you can consume more lately the
        return on investment be frost on the cake many who lean on return on investment
        find themselves unable retire in 2,008 that recently without step into your
        planner shoe I will like point out you be probably in a low income tax bracket
        now than you will be in the future this make it important consider a Roth
        IRA as your funding vehicle while not give you a current tax break it do provide
        a retirement benefit that can not be obtain elsewheretax free income there
        be other significant benefit but be able to draw down a tax free account be
        a wonderful option
      - choose a health insurance plan involve several step including determine availability
        in your state , calculate your subsidy , review rate , compare plan and enroll
        either inside or outside of the exchange that be a lot of step the process
        be incredibly simplified when you use an experienced broker do not worry they
        be free we never charge fee and our website be constantly update reflect current
        plan
      - it depend on the reason for the insurance a permanent need shall be cover
        if at all possible by a permanent policy Final Expenses be an example temporary
        need can be address with term insurance mortgage or debt will be an example
        a good experienced agent can help you put together a plan that be right for
        you
      - it will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want and the area you
        live in but I find typical coverage wil run you between $200 and $400 a year
        if you be get about $25,000 in personal property this do not include flood
        coverage if you want include flood , you need purchase a separate renter flood
        policy
      - when shall you buy whole life insurance when you be as young as possible and
        as healthy as possible whole life insurance lock in the cost , give you back
        your premium with additional gain over time and can provide a growing death
        benefit along the way the big reason for me be control the insured control
        the policy it be yours , they can not take it away , they can not raise the
        price , they can not reduce your cash value it be yours you own it
      - you shall register for Medicare in the 3 month before your 65th birthday the
        month of your 65th birthday or the 3 month after your 65th birthday if you
        do not get register during that time there be open enrollment period where
        you can still sign up the next 1 be jan 1 to mar 31, 2014
      - no condo owner insurance be not include in your fee generally refer to your
        master association document the association will insure from the wall stud
        out siding , insulation , roof and will carry liability cover the association
        you need insure from the wall stud in that include sheetrock , trim , cabinet
        , carpet , personal property and your own liability risk condo insurance be
        not very expensive since most claim happen on the outside of the building
        ( wind and hail a specific area look at be weather or not your heating and
        cooling equipment be cover by the assocation or if you need insure it
      - in addition to what Daniel Graham post many new Life Insurance policy offer
        living benefit as well as death benefit many policy have an Accelerated Death
        Benefit Rider this will pay a percentage of the face amount if the insured
        contract a terminal illness this vary according to company some contract also
        offer Long Term Care benefit and critical illness benefit while Life Insurance
        be never mean be an investment it do create an immediate estate if you put
        $100 into a money market for example and you die the next day your beneficiary
        will get $100 if you pay a $100 premium on a new life policy with a face value
        of $100,000 and you die the next day your beneficiary will get $100,000 my
        point be Life Insurance have a definite place in financial planning and with
        the living benefit many company now offer , it be even more attractive
      - full coverage be always a dangerous term most people consider full coverage
        as have comprehensive a collision coverage be on their vehicle however this
        will leave out medical rental reimbursement , towing and possible more option
        with that said the coverage be not actually full with this question be a blanket
        question it be actually impossible answer without a series of question be
        ask first such as location , age of operator , marital status , driving history
        and driving record not mention type of car I highly suggest you contact a
        local agent who can quote you multiple company find you the good coverage
        and rate fit your need
      - as a rule the answer will no. termite be not consider a cover peril most company
        homeowner be not design cover general maintenance termite fall under that
        category if a structure collapse then damage to the personal property may
        be cover possibly the structure
      - renter insurance typically cover the insured and the insured immediate family
        living within the cover premise if there be other tennats within the rent
        premise that be not immediate family member then they shall secure their own
        renter insurance coverage remember every policy be different please read your
        policy completely understand the coverage provide and any exclusion there
        may
      - pay as much as it take get the coverage you need protect you and your family
        adequately once you determine how much coverage you need shop around with
        several different insurance agent and make sure include an independent insurance
        agent that be not tie to just 1 company your rate will be base on many factor
        including coverage limit , deductible level , additional benefit , driving
        record , number and type of vehicle , age of driver and location shop around
        will ensure you have the low rate

        rep , a media related consultant or non-industry-related worker will not provide

        health care service cover from 1 product to another what prescription drug
        cover how that even when they technically explain on a web site the consumer
        either do not understand the terminology just rush past these important factor
        while focus on a few bullet point the monthly premium I have meet entirely
        too many people this year who have come regret the purchasing decision they
        make on their own and only learn the consequence of once they need use their
        coverage so do not be that person it do not cost you anymore use the service
        of a health insurance agent and you be make a decision that can literally
        have major implication for your personal financial well why will not you seek
        out professional advice

        your premium if you be look for something in the $100,000 , 10yr term insurance
        range you can be look at premium of about $35 per month to over $100+ per

        life policy be design be pay up at a relatively early duration e.g. Policy
        Year 20 , age 65 , etc. the premium for these policy be relatively high as
        a result in comparison in most case whole life policy be design have require
        premium age 95 or 100 or late such policy have relatively low premium and
        be not pay up until age 95 or 100 a policy can also be pay up at a lesser
        value than the death benefit whole life policy feature a reduce paid up non
        forfeiture provision in the event the policy owner wish stop pay annual require
        premium the policy owner can ask the insurer reduce the death benefit amount
        for the policy so that no far premium will need be pay it be important note
        policy which use policy dividend and/or the cash value of Paid Up Additions
        offset the require premium due at some future point be not pay up in a low
        interest environment like we have now dividend be be reduce from what be illustrate

        and any other car , people or object auto theft be a crime and must be report
        to the police
      - there be no rule for this other than to say that we recommend a life insurance
        policy review at least every 3 year or annually in some circumstance thus
        you will need retain the annual statement for at least three year long sometimes
        annual statement be all the family end up finding in the event of a lost policy
        so the more of those statement you keep the good
      - the good kind of health insurance be the kind that be good for you there be
        a difference between the most comprehensive coverage and what most suitable
        good for you under the new Affordable Care Act there be 4 main benefit level
        - bronze , silver , gold and platinum platinum plan be go provide the most
        comprehensive benefit but will also feature the high premium not everyone
        will be able afford a platinum plan which be why bronze , silver and gold
        be available as well the idea be reduce your premium , you take on a little
        more risk - mean you be willing take on a high deductible , high coinsurance
        / copayment , etc. keep your premium down group coverage can provide many
        benefit as well such as low premium ( the employer contribute to a percentage
        of the premium for each employee plan - the trade-off keep in mind be for
        group plan if you leave the company or be fire you lose the coverage an individual
        plan will stay with you wherever you go
      - there be various way my good advice will be contact your insurance professional
        and ask this assume you do not obtain your policy through on line source of
        course check in your car glove box there you shall find an Insurance Identification
        Card issue your carrier and show the name and contact information for that

        of your life insurance policy as an asset after your death the death benefit
        leave to your beneficiary will be count as part of your estate for federal
        estate tax purpose however if the beneficiary be your spouse your estate will
        pass to them tax free if any of the life insurance proceeds be leave when
        the spouse die that be when they will be include in the estate of course it
        be important talk to a tax attorney for specific situation and advice this
        be general knowledge and may not be accurate for your specific situation
      - begin in 2,014 health care will be mandatory for every American the PPACA

        and some government agency predict Obamacare will cost much more operate than
        previously think and will impact the economy adversely keep in mind this be
        a federal program any short fall of the program will be bear federal income
        tax payer only 53% American pay federal income tax tax will increase or the
        U.S. debt will increase or both with the imposition of Obamacare

        affordable group coverage and you purchase health insurance through a state
        or federal exchange , then you be eligible receive a tax credit for have health
        insurance this credit can be take in advance lower your monthly premium payment
