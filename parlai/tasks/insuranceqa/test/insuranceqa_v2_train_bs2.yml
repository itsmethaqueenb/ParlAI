      - Aside from the obvious dangerous loss of coverage , you may have problems
        with your Mortgage Company . If you have a mortgage and your insurance cancels
        , it is likely that you will receive a letter asking you to provide proof
        of coverage . If none is provided , it is likely that the mortgage company
        will obtain coverage on your home in THEIR interest and pass on the cost to
        you through your monthly mortgate payments . If you had been paying your insurance
        provider $ 1000 a year , you can expect that the mortgage company insurance
        policy will run you substantially more than that , say $ 3,000 . And remember
        , it covers their interest , not yours .
      - Universal life policies are somewhat tricky . What happens when you cancel
        a universal life policy depends on when you cancel the policy . In the beginning
        years of a UL it has no cash value accumulated , so if you cancel during that
        stage nothing happens other than the policy terminates . You get no money
        back . In the mid range years of the policy it will likely have some cash
        value , so if you cancel it during that period you may receive the cash value
        . In the later years of a UL , unless you have kept pace with the increasing
        `` cost of insurance '' , -LRB- in other words paid increasingly higher premiums
        -RRB- , the cash value that has accumulated may be reduced by they increasing
        cost of insurance until there is no more cash value remaining . At that point
        the policy may terminate . So if you cancel the policy while it has cash value
        you will receive the cash value . If there is no cash value when you cancel
        the policy it will simply terminate .
      - I ca n't imagine why you would want to just cancel your Whole Life insurance
        policy ! You know that you have the option of replacing your current policy
        with another policy and have all the value of the current policy transferred
        to the new policy ? However as you asked what happens when you cancel a whole
        life policy - what happens is you no longer have the insurance . If the policy
        has grown sufficient cash value to cover the surrender fees and have an excess
        , you should be able to receive the remaining cash value at the time of cancellation
        . You really should talk with a qualified Insurance Adviser and find out what
        your options are and then decide how to proceed .
      - 'Not normally . Your home insurance was designed to repair or replace your
        home if something covered happens to it . Usually , anything below ground
        is n''t covered . Now , if your home is destroyed and the insurance company
        rebuilds your home , they will usually pay to hook your sewer up , but not
        to repair or replace the pipes . if you think about the things that can happen
        to a home , a sewer pipe really ca n''t have those things happen to it . My
        big question here is : what the heck happened to your sewer pipes that you
        want covered ? Insurance is designed to repair damage that is sudden and accidental
        . There are n''t many things you can do to a sewer pipe that are sudden and
        accidental . About the only thing I can think of is if someone working underground
        hits a sewer pipe and breaks it . In this case the company working there is
        responsible for any damage they may cause .'
      - I ca n't think of a situation where it would n't be required . Your mortgage
        company has just lent you a bunch of money to buy a home . They need to be
        sure that , if something happens to the home , it will be restored to what
        it was before anything happened . They 're just protecting their investment
        . The bigger question is `` why would n't you want to insure your home ? ''
        . You just made a big commitment and have a lot of money on the line . If
        something happened to your home , what would you do ? Yes , premiums for homeowners
        insurance are high , but not as high as the repairs you 'd have to pay for
        if you did n't have insurance . Plus , it not only protects the house , but
        everything in the house . Most people do n't think they have a lot of money
        tied up in their `` things '' , but they 'd be astonished to find out what
        it would cost to replace it all .
      - When you cancel your life insurance , what happens will depend on what type
        of policy you have . If you have Term Life insurance , the policy will simply
        end . You will not get any money back unless you had ROP Term -LRB- Return
        of Premium Term -RRB- and had kept the policy long enough that you are eligible
        to receive back part of the premiums you paid in . If you have a Permanent
        Life insurance policy that accumulated cash value , you will be able to receive
        the surrender value in cash . If you want to quit paying on your Permanent
        policy but do n't necessarily want to cancel your insurance , you could roll
        the surrender value over into another life insurance policy . Or you may have
        the option to change your policy to a reduced paid up policy , which means
        that it will be a smaller policy but you will not have to make any more payments
        to it . If you cancel a permanent policy in the first years , there will be
        a surrender charge that will reduce the cash value , and if you have loans
        against the policy , those will also be deducted from what you receive from
        the cash value , along with interest on the loans . You can request a current
        illustration to see what your Whole Life or Universal Life has for cash value
        , surrender charges and loan charges .
      - This is a very relevant question because there is not a black-and-white answer
        to it . Lets suppose you have a family where mom does stay at home with the
        kids . Tragically , she dies . What is the best possible thing that can happen
        with these kids ? Really , its for dad to stay home with them . Theyve already
        lost mom . They are going to need their dad more than they ever have . He
        is THE parent . Dad may want to keep working and hire a Mary Poppins-type
        nanny , but that is the second best solution by far . He really should stay
        home from work to the greatest extent possible and just connect and bond and
        nurture and comfort these kids through what may be the most devastating occurrence
        in their life . Obviously , he will need money to be able to afford to stay
        home . That is what I think is the number one function of life insurance on
        a stay-at-home mom . This is a hard sell to insurance companies these days
        , because they keep thinking in terms of percentage of the wager earners coverage
        , and on and on . But if I get a couple who really want dad to stay home if
        the family does lose mom , I fight hard to get them a policy to make that
        happen .
      - 'Years ago , it was n''t all that uncommon to see a $ 100 deductible . Those
        days are gone . Today , our standard deductible is $ 500 but I sell more deductibles
        of $ 1.000 and $ 2,500 . There ''s a reason for this . In the past , say around
        25 years ago , a homeowners policy was very basic and really only covered
        your home and contents with a few other ancillary coverages . The consumer
        was different , also . They usually only filed a claim for something big like
        a fire or tornado . About 20 years ago or so , insurance companies thought
        it would be a good idea to add more coverages for smaller things like refrigerated
        food and others . Then , a strange thing happened : People started claiming
        these things . You see , big claims like fires are very infrequent and the
        rates were built around these rarely occurring , big losses . They were n''t
        prepared for the more frequent small losses . Therefore , a $ 100 deductible
        on a total loss does n''t add much to the claim . However , insurance companies
        began seeing a lot of smaller claims and , now , that $ 100 deductible made
        it beneficial to the consumer to claim that $ 400 loss . In fact , they became
        so frequent that it was really hurting the insurance companies profitability
        . Every claim requires people to process it , adjust it , and make a payment
        . Insurance companies were seeing these costs skyrocket and they had no choice
        but to raise premiums to offset these costs . They finally reached a point
        where they had to discourage all these small losses . The way they did it
        ? they made the $ 100 and $ 250 deductible options a lot more expensive .
        So now , a $ 500 deductible is pretty standard , with higher deductibles saving
        quite a bit off the premiums . What does this mean for you ? First , realize
        that your homeowners policy was designed to cover the catastrophic losses
        , not the small things that happen more often . In Michigan , if you have
        3 claims in a 3 year period that are n''t weather-related , your company can
        cancel your policy . This will leave you in a spot where you may have to pay
        3 or 4 times the premium your used to until you ''re eligible again . A homeowners
        policy is not a maintenance contract . As a homeowner , things are going to
        happen and the responsibility for maintaining your home is yours . My advice
        is this : Take care of your home and pay for the small things and take a higher
        deductible . You ''ll probably save more before you have claim than the difference
        in the deductible . In the long run , you ''ll be protected against the big
        things and you ''ll have more money in your pocket .'
      - It may be possible for a car insurance company to `` short rate '' your requested
        cancellation which means that they would retain a certain small percentage
        above and beyond what has been fully earned for the term and refund you the
        balance . That had been a more common practice years ago but for the most
        part , that does n't happen too much any more . For the most part , your policy
        would be cancelled as requested and the appropriate refund of any pre paid
        premium returned to you without any additional charge . Naturally , the amount
        of refund would be determined by the amount you had pre paid or the term and
        where you happen to be in that term .
      - What happens when you cancel life insurance ? You end your coverage on the
        date you provide . Any cash values or unused premium in your policy will be
        returned to you . With term insurance any unused premium will be refunded
        . Cancelation should be done in writing as cancelation often requires a signed
        document .
      - This is a difficult question to answer without viewing your specific policy
        and the coverages contained in it . Is a water heater covered within a policy
        , generally yes . It just depends on what happens . For example , general
        wear and tare is not covered under the standard homeowners policy ; however
        , if you adding coverage for appliances or household items -LRB- that would
        have cost you more each year -RRB- or you pay for a home warranty , it could
        be covered for wear and tare . If the damage is from a busted pipe that occurred
        by no fault of your own or was from a power surge , it could be protected
        if the policy is setup correctly . It does come down to what exactly you have
        your policy and within the policy what the limits are . If you have a home
        warranty program that is always the best way to go because claims with the
        warranty companies will not result in higher premiums for your homeowners
        policy , but if you take a claim against your homeowners for the coverage
        -LRB- EVEN if it is n't covered -RRB- it could result in a slight increase
        in your prices for next year . If the cost is less than your deductible it
        would n't benefit you to make a claim on the home policy either .
      - Insurance is voluntary in that it can always be cancelled . The best time
        to cancel a policy is when it is up for renewal . At that time insurance companies
        know that most customers shop for better policies/better rates and it is expected
        that some policies will be cancelled . If you cancel at the right time there
        is no further premium payment obligation on the insured .
      - Depending on your states laws . They have to give you 45 day notice in Montana
        and the can if you fraudulently put information on your application they can
        there are many reasons why they can . In many cases they Non renew you When
        you get an auto policy in most states it clearly states that you must list
        all drivers that regularly dive your auto and if you do n't then that is fraud
        and they can also use that to cancel on a Home if there is more of a risk
        then it is possible or 2 many claims there numerous factors that would apply
        contact a local agent and find out why there are many things that they can
        do to prevent this from happening
      - In order to drive a vehicle in many States , the law requires a licensed driver
        to be insured ! If the driver does not own a vehicle , a policy form is available
        by the name of ` Named Non-Owner ' Insurance ; this insurance provides liability
        and optional uninsured motorist coverage for the named insured driving a vehicle
        not titled in his/her name . If you have a Named Non-Owner Insurance policy
        , the carrier upon request will issue an SR-22 endorsement to the Governing
        State Department of Motor Vehicles . In the event that the insurance is cancelled
        , an SR-26 cancellation form is issued and sent to the Governing Department
        in order to confirm cancellation of the insurance thus cancelling the SR-22
        . If one does not desire to purchase the insurance and is merely attempting
        to get a Form SR-22 issued , there is no method to do so without keeping active
        insurance for the term that the SR-22 is required . The SR-22 is simply a
        reporting form confirming continuous coverage . Many States now require electronic
        reporting between insurance carriers and the State Department of Motor Vehicles
        .
      - Home Insurance can be changed at any time . A homeowner can cancel his or
        her insurance at any time and purchase a policy from another carrier . The
        unearned portion of paid premium will be returned to the Insured in an expeditious
        manner . A bank or mortgage company is not permitted to require a homeowner
        to purchase insurance from any specific insurance company . For homes not
        insurable under Preferred Home Insurance Programs , there are some Sub-Standard
        Programs which will accept homes which are not in the best of repair or which
        are declared a high risk to carriers , in the absence of an insurance market
        for the home , most States have a Fair Plan which will accept the risk sometimes
        on a Fire Only basis . There is a link available providing an online format
        to obtain a quote and buy home insurance online in multiple States ; it may
        be used by Escrow/Closing Professionals , Mortgage Professionals , Real Estate
        Agents and directly by Consumers . An exemplary online experience for all

      - It depends on your home policy , and what happened to the laptop . Your home
        policy protects your property against certain risks . If your laptop was stolen
        you may have coverage , but if you dropped it or spilled a drink on it that
        would not be covered on your home policy . In most cases though , your deductible
        is going to exceed the value of the laptop regardless of what caused the loss
        . Furthermore , you should try and protect your loss history . If your decuctible
        is $ 1,000 and it costs $ 1,200 to replace the laptop , your compensation
        will only be $ 200 . This may not be worth filing the claim as you may lose
        discounts for a clean loss history and the increased cost of insurance may
        not be worth it .
      - A homeowners policy can always be cancelled for non-payment of premium . In
        addition to the representations made to the agent , the underwriter also can
        order an on-site inspection . If the property isnt as described the policy
        can be cancelled . Some specific issues might be the presence of an aggressive
        dog , or poor maintenance of the home or grounds . Mortgage companies also
        report to insurance companies when a residence is vacant . The insurance company
        is likely to cancel the homeowners policy .
      - 'Under certain conditions , Medicare Part A will cover intermittent or part-time
        home health care provided by a skilled nurse . Again , Medicares requirements
        for receiving home care are quite strict . Medicare will pay for home health
        care to treat an illness or injury only if a person meetsallof the following
        requirements : - A doctor must determine that medical care is needed at home
        and must make a plan for such care . - The person needs intermittent skilled
        nursing care , physical therapy , speech therapy , or occupational therapy
        . - The person is homebound , which means generally unable to leave home -LRB-
        when a person leaves , it must be infrequent and for a short time only , such
        as to go to a doctors appointment -RRB- . - The home health care agency must
        be Medicare-approved . Keep in mind that unlike Medicares nursing home benefit
        , a person does not need to be admitted to a hospital first in order to qualify
        for Medicare home health care . In addition , services will be provided on
        an intermittent or part-time basis only by a visiting nurse , therapist ,
        or home health aide . Medicares home health care benefit does not pay for
        24-hour full-time care . Medicare generally limits its home health care benefit
        because the program is only designed to serve individuals who need intermittent
        care for a relatively short period of time rather than care on a daily basis
        . Once a person is receiving Medicare home health care , his or her plan of
        care will be reviewed at least every 60 days . If the persons health changes
        and care is no longer needed , the home health agency will notify the individuals
        doctor , who must then contact Medicare . From that point , home care will
        no longer be covered by Medicare . The Medicare home health care benefit will
        not pay for homemaker services such as housekeeping , shopping , and cleaning
        . It also does not pay for custodial carethat is , help with meeting daily
        personal needs such as bathing , toileting , transferring , or eating . Because
        most people who need long-term care need custodial care , financial practitioners
        should point out this shortcoming to clients . Many people who do qualify
        for Medicare home health care benefits still need to pay for additional custodial
        care in order to live comfortably and independently at home .'

      - You can cancel an automobile policy whenever you wish . The insurance company
        will notifythe DMV . The company will refund unused premium in one of two
        ways . Some companies still use `` short-rate '' cancellation which imposes
        a penalty for cancelling before the policy term ends . Most companies use
        `` pro-rata '' cancellation which charges just for the number of days coverage
        is in force .

      - A qualified plan is generally a government approved define benefit or defined
        contribution retirement plan . It is generally has a pretax or tax deductible
        privilege for the plan participant and accumulates tax deferred . Non-qualified
        plans are not tax deductible , but do accumulate tax deferred with annuities
        and/or life insurance .
      - No , the retirement plan offered by the military is not qualified . Public
        sector pension plans are not covered by ERISA -LRB- Employee Retirement Income
        Security Act -RRB- , and in order for a retirement plan to be qualified ,
        it must meet the regulations set forth by ERISA . Therefore , the military
        's retirement plan offered through the federal government is nonqualified
        .
      - The service addresses both ERISA qualified plans and other nonqualified supplemental
        retirement plans . Assuming this question is addressing ERISA qualified plans
        , there are several retirement plans such as the popular 401 -LRB- k -RRB-
        , 403 -LRB- b -RRB- and 412 -LRB- i -RRB- as well as others such as cash balance
        plans defined benefit plans , defined contribution plans , profit sharing
        plans .
      - Cash value life insurance products are frequently used as a retirement planning
        vehicle . Most nonqualified retirement plans , from the largest to the smallest
        companies in America , use life insurance to informally fund the retirement
        payments companies make to their retiring executives . So , it would stand
        to reason that what works for those arrangements can work for individuals
        , too ! With the right products , an experienced life insurance professional
        can design a supplemental retirement plan using life insurance to provide
        income in retirement , tax free -LRB- through policy loans -RRB- . Whole life
        is not always the best choice in terms of efficiency and flexibility . Universal
        life based products are better , in my experience .
      - Section 457 plans are nonqualified deferred compensation plans available only
        to state and local government employers , and nongovernment organizations
        exempt from tax under IRC Section 501 . Generally 457 plans are utilized for
        two reasons - 1 . As deferred compensation plans that allow participants to
        reduce their taxable salary in a manner similar to that of 401 -LRB- k -RRB-
        plans . 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans generally are not available to state and local
        government organizations . 2 . As supplemental benefit plans that provide
        executives with supplemental retirement income .
      - Bank owned life insurance -LRB- BOLI -RRB- allows banks to obtain better after
        tax return on assets than tier 1 capital . The bank is owner and beneficiary
        of the life insurance , not bank executives . Regulations have tightened in
        recent years and banks must have a legitimate reason to own life insurance
        on the lives of highly compensated executives of the bank . BOLI is usually
        set up to informally fund nonqualified benefit plans for selected executives
        . The executive is an insured in these policies but has no ownership interest
        . The executive 's family not a beneficiary of the policy though the nonqualified
        benefit agreements may have death benefit provisions which are income taxable
        to them unlike a life insurance policy death benefit . Though not BOLI , split
        dollar arrangements have reemerged which can overcome most BOLI shortcomings
        and allow both the bank and the executive to directly participate in and benefit
        from a life insurance contract .
      - In qualified retirement plans , it may make sense to annuitize the annuity
        before required minimum distributions become mandatory . In nonqualified retirement
        planning strategies , you may want to use the staggering annuity product tactic
        called annuity laddering to maximized tax deferral and utilize the combination
        of different annuities along you retirement timeline .
      - The corporation is either the total or partial beneficiary on the policy ,
        and an employee or group of employees , owner or debtor is listed as the insured
        -LRB- s -RRB- . Fundamentally , COLI differs from group life insurance policies
        that are typically offered to most or all of the employees in a company ,
        because this type of insurance is designed to protect the employees and their
        families and not the company itself . COLI can be structured in many different
        ways to accomplish many different objectives . One of the most common is to
        fund certain types of nonqualified plans , such as a split-dollar life insurance
        policy that allows the company to recoup its premium outlay into the policy
        by naming itself as the beneficiary for the amount of premium paid , with
        the remainder going to the employee who is the insured on the policy . Other
        forms of COLI include key person life insurance that pays the company a death
        benefit upon the death of a key employee , and buy-sell agreements that fund
        the buyout of a deceased partner or owner of a business . In many cases ,
        the death benefit is used to buy some or all of the shares of company stock
        owned by the deceased -LRB- such as with a closely-held business -RRB- . COLI
        is also frequently used as a means of recovering the cost of funding various
        types of employee benefits .
      - Generally speaking , if the annuity is nonqualified , the beneficiary of an
        annuity will pay taxes on the earnings . The basis , or monetary contribution
        that purchased the annuity , is not taxed . How the beneficiary is taxed depends
        on whether they receive the annuity in a lump sum or whether they annuitize
        it -LRB- take periodic payments -RRB- . If the annuity was tax qualified when
        purchased , taxes are paid on both the basis -LRB- original contribution -RRB-
        and the earnings .
      - A life insurance retirement plan is a nonqualified , tax deferred cash value
        accumulating policy . To maximize the accumulating cash values , the policy
        must be designed with lowest cost of insurance death benefit option non modified
        endowment contract . The contract death benefit and death benefit options
        must be managed throughout the life on the insurance to minimize the cost
        of insurance . There are several crediting methods available depending upon
        your risk tolerance . If the contract is designed correctly , the policy can
        generate tax free withdrawals to basis and policy loans of gain as long as
        the contract is kept in force for the life of the insured .
      - The similarity between a Roth IRA and a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan is that they
        are both qualified retirement plans . The Internal Revenue Service has issued
        regulations on both and they appear in the Code . The number 401 -LRB- k -RRB-
        is the code section that permits that specific type of retirement program
        . In both programs the income tax on earnings from money held in the program
        is tax-deferred , meaning that there isnt any income tax on the earnings in
        the current year . A Roth IRA is an individual plan . You own the plan . The
        money that you put into the plan is made with money that has already been
        taxed . You dont need to be the employee of a particular company to have a
        Roth IRA . There isnt any tax current tax deduction for the deposit . You
        can have a Roth IRA even if you have a retirement plan elsewhere . As a plan
        owner you select where the funds are to be invested , within limits . There
        are adjusted gross income limits to participation so check with your advisor
        if you have relatively high income . A non-working spouse can have a Roth
        IRA . A 401 -LRB- k -RRB- is an employer sponsored plan . Your employer sets
        up the plan and either administers the plan directly or uses a third party
        administrator to maintain the plan . Under most circumstances the employer
        states clearly who can participate in the plan . The money contributed to
        the plan is normally deducted from your paycheck before income tax is withheld
        . That is because that money is tax-deferred . There wont be any current income
        tax on that money . Sometimes employers will match some of the money contributed
        as an incentive . Particularly when the employer contributes to the plan there
        will probably be a vesting schedule . That means that the money contributed
        by the employer isnt really yours until you meet a certain criteria for service
        or participation in the plan . The plan will also stipulate whether in-service
        withdrawals can be made , and the conditions under which they can be made
        . During the accumulation phase withdrawals from a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan
        can trigger a taxable event . However , with a Roth IRA if the program has
        been in place for more than five years and you are older than 59.5 , or have
        become disabled or need the money for a first-time home purchase , there isnt
        a penalty tax of 10 % . You can also use the money for higher education costs
        . Withdrawals for education prior to your reaching age 59.5 will be subject
        to income tax even though they are not subject to the additional 10 % penalty
        tax . You can withdraw up to the total of your payments without income tax
        or the additional 10 % penalty tax . Treatment can be different under a 401
        -LRB- k. -RRB- The plan itself might not allow in-service withdrawals and
        income tax and penalty could also be charged . During the accumulation phase
        the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan will offer a limited number of investment options
        , often including an option to purchase company stock . Those are the only
        investment options available . However , a Roth IRA can be funded with a variety
        of investments and changed whenever it is deemed best by you . When you retire
        with a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- the IRS will require that starting after you reach
        70.5 you must make withdrawals every year . These are scheduled in the code
        . With a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- these withdrawals are treated as ordinary income
        and are fully taxed . This is not a requirement of your Roth IRA . Withdrawals
        are not required and when you decide to take them , they are free of income
        tax if you are over 59.5 years old . You can name a beneficiary with both
        types of plans ; however with the Roth IRA if the plan has been held for more
        than five years , the funds can pass to an heir tax-free . The key issue is
        that deposits in a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- are currently not included in your income
        tax and may be matched by your employer . The contributions to a Roth IRA
        are made with after-tax dollars . When you retire all of the money in your
        401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan will be taxed as withdrawn as ordinary income , however
        , none of the money from a Roth IRA will be taxed .
      - A retirement plan can be qualified defined benefit or contribution plan or
        a non-qualified plan . If your tax bracket is high you may select a qualified
        plan with pretax contributions as an example . Funding your retirement plan
        with saving and investment products will depend on your personal financial
        profile that should include a risk assessment analysis and timeline that benchmark
        your retirement date and life expectancy .
      - 'Retirement planning can be seem overwhelming since it involves so many different
        issues . The most difficult part for most is clarifying what do you want your
        retirement to look like . Travel , hobbies , charity work , new work ? The
        point is , once you have clarified your objectives , you can work on the ``
        financials '''' . How much do you need to accumulate ? What vehicles work
        best ? What about tax ? If you have further questions , or feel that I could
        be of assistance , please do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like
        to work with a local Retirement Planner , you could start with a Google search
        . For example , if you search for : retirement planner Halifax or retirement
        planning Halifax , my name , along with several others , will come up . You
        can use the same method to find Retirement Planners in your community .'
      - First create a financial profile that includes your timeline to retirement
        , your life expectancy , your tax bracket and your risk tolerance . Estimating
        timelines will help you frame your retirement planning . Knowing your tax
        bracket will help you decide whether to use a qualified or non qualified retirement
        plan . Determining your risk tolerance will also help your select the right
        investment product . You need to discover if your employer sponsors a retirement
        plan , especially if it offers matching contributions . This can help you
        decide whether to use an individual or employer sponsored retirement plan
        .
      - You need to determine your tax bracket , your risk tolerance , your contributions
        , how long will you work and what is your life expectancy ? This will help
        you in your selection between a qualified or non-qualified plan . It will
        also assist you in the product selection based on your time horizon and risk
        thresholds . If you 're an individual you may consider an IRA or a Roth IRA
        . If your employer sponsors a defined contribution qualified plan like a 402
        -LRB- k -RRB- , you may want to participate .
      - For a pension plan to be Qualified it must comply with the Internal Revenue
        Code -LRB- IRC . -RRB- Employer sponsored plans that provide for separate
        employee accounts can qualify under section 401 -LRB- k -RRB- of the IRC .
        Retirement plans do not need to be qualified but to obtain a reduction in
        current income tax , they must be qualified . An Individual Retirement Account
        is qualified under the IRC .
      - A retirement plan can be a deductible qualified or nondeductible non-qualified
        plan , generally consisting of annuities and life insurance . The retirement
        plan should have a future estimated year for the beginning of retirement as
        well as a life expectancy year for death . The retirement plan should reflect
        the personal financial profile of the plan participant which includes risk
        tolerance , product suitability and the established timeline as cited above
        . Product diversity should be a consideration when assigning the allocation
        of the plans product holdings .
      - What does a qualified retirement plan mean ? It means a retirement plan that
        offers some sort of tax benefit to the participant in their savings towards
        retirement in a particular plan . A qualified plan provides benefits that
        will boost the outcome possibilities in most cases . The plans also come with
        limits and conditions that must be met .
      - A private health insurance exchange is a private sector counterpart to the
        Federal Government run or state run health insurance exchanges created as
        a centerpiece of ObamaCare . A private health insurance exchange or marketplace
        as is now the preferred term , is generally going to be an employer based
        program that offers multiple health insurance plan options to its employees
        . There are variations on the private health insurance marketplace theme .
        Some are built around the offering of individual health insurance plans from
        one or a number of different health insurance carriers . Others are built
        around one group insurance carrier that offers a variety of different plan
        designs at varying price points for employees to choose from . Still some
        others are large enough that more than one group health insurance carrier
        is electing to participate and offer a selection of health insurance plans
        , so in this last example you could have plans from Humana , United Healthcare
        and CIGNA all being offered alongside each other thus giving employees an
        even broader selection of plan designs and perhaps provider networks to choose
        from . In some cases there can be integration between a private exchanges
        and the government based exchanges . This is most commonly found in private
        exchanges built around offering individual health insurance plans . This can
        then allow for employees who would qualify for subsidies through the government
        health insurance exchanges to enroll in those plans while employees who do
        not qualify for subsidies can enroll in health insurance plans offered outside
        of the government exchanges . Another advantage that private exchanges can
        have over their government based counterparts is that they can offer a wide
        array of other employee or individual insurance options such as dental , vision
        , life , disability , critical illness , cancer and accident insurance . Some
        private exchanges can even extend the one stop shopping concept to auto ,
        homeowners and other property & casualty based insurance products.The government
        health marketplaces are currently limited to health insurance and some dental
        insurance options . If you are interested in learning about whether a private
        health insurance exchange might be the right solution for your employee benefit
        needs please feel free to contact me .
      - A qualified annuity differs from a non-qualified annuity , which is an annuity
        funded with after-tax dollars . While distributions -LRB- contributions to
        a qualified annuity are pre-tax -RRB- from a qualified annuity are taxed as
        income , distributions from a non-qualified annuity are not subject to income
        tax in their entirety . Qualified annuities are often set up by employers
        on behalf of their employees as part of a retirement plan .
      labels:
      - A qualified plan is generally a government approved define benefit or defined
        contribution retirement plan . It is generally has a pretax or tax deductible
        privilege for the plan participant and accumulates tax deferred . Non-qualified
        plans are not tax deductible , but do accumulate tax deferred with annuities
        and/or life insurance .

      - This is a very pertinent question in the era of ObamaCare . As the term ``
        portability '' implies , this is the ability for a person to own and take
        their health insurance coverage with them regardless of their employment circumstances
        . The concern about portability of health insurance coverage flows from the
        history in our nation where for many decades most working Americans received
        their health insurance coverage through their employer . In an era where many
        people would work for the same company for most , if not all , of their working
        life , there was little concern about losing access to health insurance coverage
        . As our global economy and the American workforce have evolved over the last
        generation and it is now common for a person to work for multiple companies
        over the course of their working lives and having your health insurance tied
        to your place of employment has become more problematic for some people and
        become a social , business and political issue . A common example is the person
        who works for a company that provides health insurance benefits to its employees
        and this person has a pre-existing health condition like diabetes or has a
        covered dependent with a chronic health problem requiring expensive ongoing
        care that is covered by their current employer 's health plan . One day this
        employee may be presented with a job opportunity with another company that
        offers them a promotion and an increase in pay that would further their career
        but this prospective new employer does not offer health insurance to its employees
        . Losing their current employer 's health coverage might have left this person
        or their dependents uninsurable or faced with such high out-of-pocket expenses
        for individual health insurance and out-of-pocket expenses that these factors
        would negate the new job opportunity being offered this person . Similar examples
        can be given for the person who wants to leave and start their own business
        , medical cost issues have made it difficult , if not impossible , for some
        people to pursue such opportunities . This is what is referred to as `` Job
        Lock '' . One of the positive aspects of ObamaCare is that with its guaranteed
        issue and no pre-existing conditions exclusions or coverage waiting period
        requirements , people are guaranteed access to individual or small group health
        insurance . Technically , this does break the chains of `` job lock '' for
        such persons . Please note though , that I stressed the changes made by ObamaCare
        have removed barriers to access to health insurance . Depending upon the income
        level of the person , it -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- may or may not remove the cost
        barriers associated with getting health insurance due to the resulting increases
        in health insurance rates we have seen and are seeing . But , in the ideal
        scenario , these new provisions of the health law provide persons with the
        security of owning their own health insurance coverage that is not tied to
        their place of employment thus eliminating concerns about `` job lock '' and
        freeing them to pursue other professional or personal goals that they might
        not have otherwise been able to address .
      - In an aggregate sense , Yes . The basic costs of health care -LRB- doctor
        & hospital services , prescription drugs , etc. -RRB- and our population 's
        consumption of health care services have been steadily increasing for decades
        . Health insurance costs are merely a reflection of these underlying factors
        . When one drills down to a specific company 's or a specific individual 's
        history with their health insurance premiums then you will find substantial
        variations in individual results . A knowledgeable and experienced health
        insurance broker/consultant can often manage their client 's benefits costs
        in ways that `` beat the market '' just like there always are some financial
        experts who outperform their peers in the stock market . The vast majority
        of my small business clients for instance have premium costs and benefit levels
        in 2014 that are not radical departures from their costs of a few to several
        years ago or , at the worst , they know that they have the best possible base
        cost level currently available to them in their marketplaces . This requires
        constant oversight of changing marketplace conditions , switching insurance
        carriers to take advantage of whichever carrier has the best value proposition
        at that particular time , and some fine tuning of benefit plan designs and
        funding approaches over a period of years to accomplish these results . But
        , it can be done because I have done it . The implementation of the new requirements
        of ObamaCare have upset the long established rules for the health insurance
        marketplace and are having a profound impact on health insurance plan designs
        and costs . ObamaCare addressed many access issues to health insurance coverage
        -LRB- guaranteed issue of policies , no pre-existing conditions , etc. -RRB-
        but really does nothing to reduce either healthcare costs or consumption .
        In fact , many can argue that ObamaCare is helping to increase both costs
        and consumption which will translate into higher health insurance costs .
        Certainly ObamaCare is the most profound change in our nation 's health insurance
        system in most people 's lifetimes and it will make the years ahead much more
        challenging for both individuals and businesses when it comes to managing
        their health insurance & health care costs . The guidance of an experienced
        health insurance expert who is staying on top of the rapid changes being prompted
        by ObamaCare is now more important than ever to both the individual and business
        health insurance consumer . If I can be of assistance in guiding you through
        these uncharted waters please feel free to contact me so I can put my 30 years
        of experience to work for you .

      - There are numerous factors involved in the rising cost of health insurance
        and one could write a book about them . Some of the most important factors
        are ; 1 -RRB- Health care costs continue to rise . Whether it is hospital
        services , physician care , prescription drugs or virtually any health care
        service you can name , their costs continue to rise from one year to the next
        . Health insurance rates are merely a reflection of the underlying costs of
        the health care services their policies cover . 2 -RRB- Obamacare Taxes and
        Fees - buried in your health insurance premiums are taxes and fees that were
        created by the `` Affordable Care Act '' . Some are direct such as a reinsurance
        fee that was over $ 5 per covered person per month in 2014 and is to be used
        to offset losses that insurance companies may incur from enrolling too many
        unhealthy members now that ObamaCare has prohibited underwriting for risk
        and pre-existing conditions exclusions , to the medical device tax that adds
        to the cost of a wide variety of medical devices such as artificial hip joints
        . These increased costs are , of course , passed on to the consumer . 3 -RRB-

        requires that health insurance policies be `` guaranteed issue '' -LRB- a
        person ca n't be declined for coverage -RRB- and that no pre-existing condition
        exclusions , limitations or waiting periods are allowed . This literally means
        that a person can be terminally ill or about to give birth and if they enroll
        during the annual open enrollment period or a special election period they
        are guaranteed to get coverage . Obviously , taking on a claim that can range
        from thousands of dollars to a million or more when the insurance company
        in turn may receive only a tiny fraction of that amount in premium payments
        from the sick or injured person creates a shortfall that has to be made up
        through higher premiums for other insured persons . 4 -RRB- Increasing consumption
        of health care services . As the American population ages -LRB- with the Baby
        Boom generation moving into its retirement years -RRB- they naturally consume
        more health care services of all types . With the barriers to access to health
        insurance being removed and Medicaid eligibility expansion this also increases
        the consumption of health care services . A basic law of economics is that
        increased demand for something with a limited supply -LRB- there are only
        so many doctors , hospitals , etc. -RRB- will lead to higher prices . While
        this is not a comprehensive list of the factors driving health insurance costs
        higher , these are some of the key ingredients .
      - 'The definition of `` good '''' varies from person to person and business
        to business . However , here are some of the aspects of a health insurance
        policy I advise my clients to be aware of and comfortable with : 1 -RRB- Are
        the doctors , hospitals and pharmacies you want to use in-network providers
        with the health insurance plan you are considering ? 2 -RRB- What would your
        coverage be -LRB- if any -RRB- if you want to use a health care provider who
        is not an in-network provider with the health insurance plan you are considering
        ? 3 -RRB- What is the pharmacy benefit under the health plan you are considering
        ? And , if you have specific prescription drug needs are they covered under
        the health insurance plan ''s prescription formulary and to what extent are
        they covered -LRB- copays , co-insurance , deductible & co-insurance -RRB-
        ? 4 -RRB- Does the health insurance plan allow its members to go directly
        to specialists such as cardiologists or does it require that you are referred
        to a specialist by your primary care physician first ? 5 -RRB- If you travel
        regularly outside of your home area -LRB- to other states or outside the USA
        -RRB- does the health plan provide for coverage outside of your home service
        area in the event you need non-emergency care ? 6 -RRB- Is the health insurance
        company you are considering a well established national or regional health
        insurance carrier with strong finances or is it one of the new , experimental
        Co-Op health plans recently established under the provisions of ObamaCare
        ? 7 -RRB- Does the overall value proposition of the health insurance plan
        you are considering meet your current and anticipated needs ? In other words
        , does its monthly premium , coverage levels and provider network really work
        for you .'
      - Health insurance paid by an employer for coverage on an employee or the employee
        ' s dependents is deductible as a normal business expense under IRC Section
        162 . Health insurance benefits are not wages and therefore are not subject
        to wage taxes . For this purpose , the term `` employee '' includes an owner/employee
        of a C-corporation but does not include owner employees of other types of
        businesses . Self-employed individuals may deduct 100 % of the cost of health
        insurance as an `` above the line '' expense on the front page of their Form
        1040 . The deduction is available to all qualifying taxpayers , regardless
        of whether they choose to itemize their other expenses . Direct deductions
        from gross income are allowed only to the extent of the amount of net self-employment
        income . Excess amounts , if any , may be deducted of Schedule A as listed
        in the `` Individuals '' section below . The term `` self-employed person
        '' for this purpose includes non-salaried owners of S-corporations , LLCs
        , partners and sole proprietors underIRC Section 162i . WEBSITELINK Except
        for salaried owner/employees , health insurance paid by a business on behalf
        of a self-employed person is not a deductible business expense . For example
        , if an S-corporation that pays for health insurance for its non-salaried
        owner/employee , this expense is not listed as a business expense on the Form
        1120 but rather the deduction flows directly through the Form 1120S to the
        individual owner ' s Form 1040 . Health insurance for salaried owner/employees
        is treated the same as regular employees except that an adjustment for self-employment
        tax is made . Health insurance benefits provided by an employer are not taxable
        income underIRC section104and105 . This includes amounts paid by the employer
        to reimburse the employee for the cost of health insurance . Of course , the
        employee may not `` double-dip '' by deducting the cost of these tax-free
        benefits on an individual tax return . The cost of health insurance paid by
        individuals is tax deductible only to the extend that the cost of coverage
        they paid , in combination with some other specified expenses , is more than
        7.5 % of adjusted gross income . For most people , this limitation effectively
        means that they do not get a tax deduction for the cost of health insurance
        paid . The cost of health insurance paid by an employer is a deductible personal
        expense if the amount is included as wages in Box 1 of Form W2 , but this
        is a relatively rare situation .
      - Health insurance rates increase because the underlying cost of health care
        services increases every year and our population 's average consumption of
        health care services has been increasing for many years . If the cost of gasoline
        steadily rises and at the same time you are driving more miles each year then
        you understand it costs you more to operate your car . Health care services
        are the gasoline and using more health care per person is the increased miles
        driven part of the analogy above . That addresses the basic economic factors
        that have been happening for decades . Now add to those the impacts of the
        Affordable Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- and you have a whole new set of
        cost drivers being added to the equation . For example , ObamaCare does add
        taxes and fees to insurance plan costs and medical devices - these costs are
        passed on to the consumer . The law mandates that a wide range of preventive
        health care services must be covered at 100 % , all policies must cover maternity
        -LRB- many individual policies did n't -RRB- , no medical underwriting is
        allowed , polices must be guaranteed to be issued and pre-existing conditions
        must be covered immediately , and these are just some highpoints of the coverage
        changes now required . While all of these requirements may sound good , and
        they do benefit many people , there is no way around the fact that such changes
        will increase health care consumption even further . More demand for a finite
        resource equals higher costs . An aging American population is also a driver
        of increased health care consumption and , with the Baby Boom generation entering
        their retirement years , will be for years to come . This gives you a generaloutline
        of why your health insurance rates have been increasing and will continue
        to be increasing for the foreseeable future . As I described above , our nation
        has many structural issues that drive health insurance rates higher . Despite
        its name , the Affordable Care Act serves mainly to expand access to health
        insurance and health care but does very little to address any of the underlying
        factors that lead to higher health insurance rates .
      - Utilization management guidelines/requirements in health insurance/managed
        care companiesare designed to maximize the effective use of health care resources
        in a cost effective manner . Such guidelines/requirements can apply to the
        provider of health care services and/or to the insured person . Depending
        upon the insurance carrier and the health insurance program you are enrolled
        in these guidelines/requirements may be either active or passive . This means
        in some cases they are more like strong suggestions with little or no negative
        consequences for non-compliance and in other cases the guidelines/requirements
        must be complied with for the services to be covered at the in-network level
        of benefits or to not be declined for payment . Utilization management is
        a far reaching term that can touch virtually every aspect of health care from
        physician care to prescription utilization . The objective is to establish
        a set of recommended best practices and steps in treatment to be followed
        when dealing with a person 's health problems . For example , you might be
        required to try a long established prescription medication that is now a lower
        cost generic to treat a condition and have to show that the desired results
        were not being obtained before you might be approved for a newer , name brand
        medication that treats the same condition but is much more expensive . Having
        certain procedures performed on an outpatient basis rather than requiring
        a hospitalization is another example . The bottom line is that utilization
        management protocols attempt to get the appropriate level of care in the most
        appropriate and cost effective setting to maximize the value of our health
        care dollars . Sometimes utilization management can be a complicating factor
        in a patient 's and/or doctor 's experience as it may require everyone to
        go through steps A , B , C & D rather than jumping right from step A in treatment
        to step D. But , with insurance costs continuing their relentless rise , the
        consumer should anticipate that utilization management will be much more prominent
        in their health care than ever before .
      - A Medigap policy plugs the gaps that Medicare A & B does n't cover . A person
        can get a Medigap plan part of what Medicare does not may or they can get
        a Medigap plan to cover all of what Medicare does not pay . The cost varies
        depending on which plan a person chooses .
      - 'The answer here is `` maybe '''' . It really depends upon the situation and
        the coverage . In general , if you consider the same house and the same coverage
        , the homeowners coverage will cost you less . let ''s start with some terms
        . In the industry , we usually call landlord insurance either dwelling fire
        , or a dwelling policy . It points to the difference between this and a homeowners
        policy . A homeowners policy has 6 coverages : A. Dwelling - the structure
        B . Other Structures - detached garages , shed ''s , pole barns , etc. . C.
        Personal Property - Your stuff D. Loss of Use - The extra costs you ''ll incur
        if you have to live somewhere while your home is repaired E. Personal Liability
        - Protects you from being sued F. Medical Payments - Pays for injuries that
        happen on your property without having to be sued . A Dwelling Policy , in
        general does n''t have any coverage C , Personal Property . As a landlord
        , you ''re worried about the building and your liability . Your tenant ''s
        personal property is their responsibility to insure . Dwelling policies are
        more complicated to put together than homeowners policies but I ''ll leave
        that discussion for another time . Lets talk about why Dwelling Policy usually
        costs more than a Homeowners policy . With a homeowners policy the insurance
        company has a greater sense of security because they only have one entity
        to worry about , the homeowners and their family . They have a financial interest
        in keeping their home safe , secure , and in good repair . With a rental property
        , you may have many different tenants occupy that home and they have no financial
        interest in the home itself . A tenant is much more likely to let things go
        that may eventually cause a claim . Additionally , with a homeowners policy
        , the liability is protecting the insured from others , with a dwelling policy
        , you ''re also being protected from the people that actually occupy the home
        . Now , one last thing to mention . If you ''re renting your home and it ''s
        insured on a homeowners policy , change it now . If there ''s a claim on the
        home and the insurance company finds out it ''s being rented , they may refuse
        to pay your claim . Most homeowners policies require the home to be occupied
        by the owner for coverage to apply . Find a good agent that knows how this
        works and how to put this coverage together for your situation . It ''s much
        better to know what your coverage is and make choices rather then to think
        you have coverage you really do n''t'
      - I 'm unsure exactly of whether you are referring to regular health insurance
        or long-term care insurance . Either way , the cost of coverage under both
        types of insurance will vary from person to person . For health insurance
        , your age , where you live , if you use tobacco products , the carrier you
        purchase through , your plan metal level , and if you qualify for a subsidy
        to reduce your premium will determine how much a good policy is going to cost
        . Under the Affordable Care Act , you have the options for bronze , silver
        , gold , and platinum level plans -LRB- as you go up in metal , the price
        goes up , but provides better benefits -RRB- - some areas also have a catastrophic
        plan available . In addition , your age is a big factor as well . The younger
        you are , the cheaper your premium - the older you are , the higher your premium
        . Tobacco usage can increase your premiums up to 50 % as well . If you 're
        referring to long-term care coverage , a number of factors can affect the
        cost of the policy such as your gender , where you live , the monthly benefit
        of the policy , the policy 's benefit period , any discounts when spouses
        apply together , etc. . It 's always helpful to consult with an experienced
        insurance broker who can work with you on a personal level and help you determine
        which plan will work best for your specific needs . I hope the information
        is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with your coverage or
        if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
      - 'Renters Insurance premium depends on the amount of Personal Property coverage
        needed , the amount of Personal Liability coverage needed and your requested
        deductible . It is important to note that your personal property -LRB- contents
        -RRB- coverage and deductible will make up 75 % - 85 % of the premium ; the
        personal liability which in our view is much more valuable only costs a small
        percentage of the premium . We always recommend the maximum available coverage
        for Personal Liability ; depending on your State & location , the maximum
        may cost as little as $ 40 more premiumper year . For a self service quote

      - Full Coverage , or what is known traditionally as Major Medical does not have
        a standard price . The cost depends greatly on a variety of factors . How
        much competition is there in your area ? The more insurance carriers offering
        coverage the better . They will compete to keep costs down to attract membership
        . How big is the population in your area ? The more people the better . Larger
        populations help spread the cost of coverage around to more payers . Then
        when there is a major medical expense there is a larger number of people whose
        premiums cover the cost to the insurer . What state do you live in ? Every
        state has their own mandates on the amount of coverage you might have . Some
        set a high bar which means higher premiums , some stick with the bare minimum
        demanded by the Affordable Care Act which means lower premiums . Also some
        states allow pricing based on age . Younger people are lower risk so their
        premiums are lower . Some mandate a flat rate regardless of age . Exchange
        versus Commercial Insurance ? Commercial insurance -LRB- insurance from your
        employer -RRB- , or buying directly from the insurance company as an individual
        , might be priced differently than buying from an exchange . Depending on
        your current financial state you may qualify for subsidies from the government
        which would lower the cost of the product even though it is the same as the
        product offered to an employer . An exchange navigator would be able to educate
        you on your specific circumstances . Does your employer offer insurance ?
        Finally , the cost of insurance may be dictated by your employer . It depends
        on the plans they choose to offer as well as the amount they may choose to
        contribute to your purchase of the coverage . Some employer pay for the whole
        thing , some pay half , some may pay a flat amount , others offer it but do
        n't pay anything . I know that 's not a clear cut answer but there is no standard
        price that one can look to . consult your employer , a broker , or an exchange
        navigator for expert advice .
      - There is a huge range in answer to that figure . I depends on your health
        , first and foremost , as if your health is bad , you may be completely uninsurable
        . If insurable , but in bath health , expect the premium to be much higher
        than if you are in excellent health . Then it goes by age , the younger the
        less expensive . Then what kind of life insurance do you want , permanent
        or term ? Term starts out cheaper but become more expensive as years go by
        . Finally , how much coverage do you want . Certainly $ 3 millions costs much
        more than $ 100 thousand . A capable agent can find the best package to meet
        your needs and abilities . Gary Lane , Agent , New York Life , 949 797 2424

      - How much renters insurance premiums depend on how much coverage you actually
        would like to carry on your personal items and how much liability protection
        you would like to obtain . Rates can run as low as 100.00 - 300.00 per year
        on average . I recommend you consult a local independent agent and discuss
        your personal needs .
      - How does health insurance work while on disability ? Since I just ended 12
        months of disability that included many hospitalizations and treatments ,
        I can tell you it works exactly the same as not being disabled . Disability
        insurance protects your income , health insurance protects your health . You
        can have both going on at once . Depending on your employment situation ,
        how your health insurance is paid for may make a difference . Maybe your employer
        continues to pick it up , maybe it 's covered under workman 's comp , maybe
        you pay your own premiums . . the main thing is health insurance does n't
        go away if you 're collecting disability insurance .
      - Applying for individual health insurance under the requirements of the Affordable
        Care Act -LRB- ObamaCare -RRB- is no longer something a person is necessarily
        free to do whenever they choose . In the largest sense , ObamaCare envisions
        the overwhelming number of individual health insurance enrollments to occur
        during the designated annual open enrollment period . This year the open enrollment
        period begins on November 15th , 2014 . So , depending upon your personal
        circumstances you may not even be able to apply for individual health insurance
        until then for coverage effective January 1 , 2015 at the earliest . If you
        have experienced a change of life status event during this year -LRB- e.g.
        - marriage , divorce , loss of employer based coverage , aging off of parent
        's plan -RRB- then you have 60-days after that event to enroll in individual
        health insurance coverage . It sounds like you would be well served to seek
        the services of an experienced health insurance agent who can help you determine
        if you might qualify for any premium subsidy and whether your health insurance
        needs would best be met by insurance carriers and products either inside the
        government health insurance marketplaces or in the traditional health insurance
        marketplace . Of course , you can go to HealthCare.Gov or check out some other
        Internet based insurance shopping services but I do raise a note of caution
        about this to the normal health insurance consumer . The health care reform
        law has made understanding and comparing health insurance benefits , coverage
        and provider networks more complicated than ever and it is an environment
        that is still evolving . Getting some professional guidance is n't going to
        cost you anymore and it will provide you the assurance that you understand
        what you are buying and why .
      - From me , of course . If you are like most Americans shopping for health insurance
        is not only about as exciting as watching paint dry but you also find yourself
        in a world you do n't fully understand and where the people seem to speak
        a foreign language . Of course , you can always go online and shop around
        or , even more fun , go to HealthCare.Gov or your state 's health insurance
        marketplace and shop there . That works for some people but millions of others
        have learned the painful lesson that there are a lot of factors to consider
        when making a purchase as important as health insurance that are very difficult
        to present concisely on a web site . Seek out the services of a qualified
        life and health insurance agent . An independent agent not tied to one specific
        insurance company can shop the entire marketplace for you and can be impartial
        . An agent with additional professional certifications such as Chartered Benefits
        Consultant , Certified Employee Benefits Consultant , Registered Health Underwriter
        are examples of professionals who have taken their education and training
        beyond the simple requirements to get a life and health insurance license
        . These are the characteristics I would recommend you look for in a health
        insurance agent . It does n't cost you anything extra to get these professional
        's services and they do all the work , can answer your questions , and point
        out those not so obvious issues with provider networks , how your specific
        medical and/or prescription needs are covered by different plans that the
        average consumer often misses or does n't even know to ask about . ObamaCare
        has not made all health insurance policies equal , quite the opposite in fact
        . Ask your friends or co-workers , do an Internet search for health insurance
        agents , or contact me . But you 'll be glad that you got professional guidance
        on this matter .

      - How do you convert a term policy to whole life ? The best way is to contact
        your agent or if you do n't have one , the company directly and they will
        assign you one . Usually a conversion is nothing more than filling out a single
        page . For a lot of people this is great deal because you no longer have to
        prove your health . So if your health is bad conversion is a great idea .
      - Most term life insurance policies have a convertible provision to permanent
        life insurance or in most cases whole life . This is a great feature for those
        who now have health issues which could cause them not to get a good rate on
        life insurance or even uninsurable all together . I would contact your agent
        . It may make sense to convert all or part of your term to perm . If you are
        still in good health it may make better sense to purchase whole life new and
        replace the old term policy . In most cases convertible term is not the most
        affordable option if health is not an issue . Your term life carrier is assuming
        risk with conversion and that does come at a price . Just be sure to weigh
        all of your options before converting . Good luck !
      - First , `` converting '' a Term policy to Whole Life is n't what it sounds
        like . In most cases there is a time limit by which you must `` convert ''
        otherwise you loose the one benefit of this kind of conversion . Some , -LRB-
        very few -RRB- , providers will actually credit a small amount of what has
        been paid into the Term policy to the new Whole Life policy as long as you
        're converting with the same provider . When `` converting '' from Term to
        Whole Life within the allotted time frame , the one benefit that is being
        `` converted '' to the new policy is the `` classification '' of the insured
        . In other words if the classification was `` Preferred '' or `` Standard
        '' , -LRB- whatever the classification was -RRB- , with the Term policy ,
        that same classification will be given to the new policy without having to
        have another medical exam or underwriting . But the premium for the new policy
        will be adjusted to the attained age of the insured as well as the benefit
        amount . So how do you go about converting your Term to a Whole Life ? Contact
        your agent or the provider , let them know that 's what you would like to
        do . You may be able to or you may not be able to . In either case you most
        likely will loose any money paid into the Term policy .
      - That is a great question ! Your policy should have a clause that outlines
        the details of your conversion process , but here 's what you want to do .
        If you purchased the policy through an agent , contact them and let them know
        what you are wanting to do . They will then tell you if your policy is convertible
        , and if so what that conversion will buy for you in a whole life policy .
        You should be aware that your coverage amount will be much lower , and if
        you want to keep the face value that your premiums will become much more expensive
        . Whole life policies are more expensive than term policies are because of
        their cash accumulation features , and the higher risk to the insurer - they
        do n't have to pay out on many term policies , but have to pay out on nearly
        every whole life one . Decide where your budget allows , and what minimum
        coverage you want to keep , and have your agent work with you on getting as
        close to those numbers as possible.I think the conversion is a great idea
        . If you have questions , please do n't hesitate to contact me , okay ? Thanks
        for asking !
      - Such a conversion may be possible so long as your term policy includes such
        a provision . Talk to your Insurance Professional about your contract and
        whatever options and benmefits may be included in it . In many cases , you
        may find that you can convert all or a portion of your term coverage into
        whole life or other form of permanent life insurance . In many cases , this
        conversion benefit also states that you can do so without having to provide
        any proof of `` insurability '' , in other words , without any physical exam
        or reports by your Doctor being needed . Understand that if available , the
        conversion would take place at your current age and the rates applied accordingly
        so the younger you are when you decide to take advantage of this option ,
        the better off financially you will be .
      - 'Converting Term to Permanent Insurance requires several things : 1 -RRB-
        Your policy must offer that provision ; 2 -RRB- You must take advantage of
        that provision in the time frame allotted -LRB- each policy has its own deadline
        to convert - such as within x number of years or by a certain age -RRB- ;
        3 -RRB- You can only convert up to the face amount of your current policy
        , and there will be a minimum face amount , as well ; 4 -RRB- You must convert
        to the type of policies offered for conversion by your insurance company -LRB-
        some allow you to convert to any of their permanent products , while others
        may offer a very narrow range of policy choices to convert to -RRB- ; and
        5 -RRB- You may or may not be able to keep the remainder of your coverage
        in Term insurance . If your agent is no longer around , contact an agent you
        trust and give them permission to contact your insurer and develop some options
        for you . By understanding minimum face amounts , premium `` banding ''''
        , and other features offered by that carrier , a knowledgeable agent can get
        you the most bang for your buck . E.g. . If you are in good health or still
        want Term insurance , you may be better off getting a new policy . If you
        are in poor health , you may be able to save money by converting to a policy
        guaranteed not to lapse for a limited number of years , rather than paying
        for a lifetime guarantee . Conversions are easy to execute but can be complicated
        to decide , so having a consumer driven agent in your corner can really help
        .'
      - 'Here is a simple 2-step formula to follow : 1 . Get prequalified for coverage
        with another carrier so you can compare prices . This way you will confirm
        that the premium you will be charged for conversion is the best available
        . 2 . Depending on the results of that analysis , either apply with the new
        company or simply fill out a conversion application with the term carrier
        . There you go . Either way , you will know you have made the right decision
        :-RRB-'
      - First , `` converting '' a Term policy to Whole Life is n't what it sounds
        like . In most cases there is a time limit by which you must `` convert ''
        otherwise you loose the one benefit of this kind of conversion . Some , -LRB-
        very few -RRB- , providers will actually credit a small amount of what has
        been paid into the Term policy to the new Whole Life policy as long as you
        're converting with the same provider . When `` converting '' from Term to
        Whole Life within the allotted time frame , the one benefit that is being
        `` converted '' to the new policy is the `` classification '' of the insured
        . In other words if the classification was `` Preferred '' or `` Standard
        '' , -LRB- whatever the classification was -RRB- , with the Term policy ,
        that same classification will be given to the new policy without having to
        have another medical exam or underwriting . But the premium for the new policy
        will be adjusted to the attained age of the insured as well as the benefit
        amount . So how do you go about converting your Term to a Whole Life ? Contact
        your agent or the provider , let them know that 's what you would like to
        do . You may be able to or you may not be able to . In either case you most
        likely will loose any money paid into the Term policy .
      - 'Yes , Term life insurance can be converted to Whole life or some other form
        of permanent insurance if : 1 -RRB- The policy you got has the option to be
        converted , 2 -RRB- you convert it within the time frame noted , and 3 -RRB-
        you can afford the premium for the converted policy . While a life insurance
        company may carry many types of permanent coverage , they do not always offer
        all of them to be used for conversions . Some companies only allow a term
        policy to be converted to one or two permanent policies , and those may not
        have all the guarantees or features that you might have chosen if the whole
        array of permanent products was available to you . Also , the permanent policy
        will be priced at the rates of that time , and at the age the insured person
        is at the time of conversion You can reduce the face amount to the minimum
        allowed for that permanent policy , but even $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 can be
        costly at an older age and for a permanent product . That being said , being
        able to convert a Term policy to Whole life or Universal life is a great feature
        , especially if someone has had a downturn in health after getting their initial
        Term insurance . There are no health requirements to convert Term life insurance
        , and the health rating for the converted policy will be the same as it was
        for the original Term policy .'
      - If the only conversion option your policy offers is Whole Life , the rate
        is probably going to be quite a bit higher than if you take out a new , no
        lapse , Universal Life policy . However , when you convert Term Life , you
        are rated the same on your Whole Life that you were rated on your Term policy
        . So if your health has declined , you may be getting a good deal by converting
        . If it has not declined , I personally would check out a new policy to see
        how much you can save . As to when to convert , it depends on several factors
        . 1 . HOW MUCH you want to convert . If you want to convert it all , it may
        be a good idea to do it now , while rates are lower . They will go up quite
        a bit over the next 10 years . 2 . YOUR HEALTH . If you have very poor health
        , you may just want to pay those low Term rates another 10 years . If you
        have excellent health , it might be a good time to convert or look at what
        else you can get in a permanent policy . 3 . WILL YOU NEED LIFE INSURANCE
        after age 60 ? By the time you are 60 you should have a good idea of whether
        you will need that much coverage . You have some time to get a feel for how
        your retirement is going to pan out before you make this big decision . You
        can not reverse it and go back to Term , once you have converted your policy
        . Please feel free to contact me to help you ascertain what prices are out
        there for you , or help you figure out what direction to go . Best wishes
        .
      - The cost of life insurance can range from a few dollars per month to many
        thousands per month . The real question is how much would it cost you to get
        the proper policy for your situation . In order to find that out you need
        to first determine how much death benefit you need . The best way to calculate
        how much life insurance you need is by doing a comprehensive needs analysis
        . If you are looking for a quick rule-of-thumb , we recommend you carry at
        least ten times your annual income in life insurance . The second factor is
        how long do you think you will need the coverage . You might want life insurance
        to cover your mortgage which will be paid off in a certain period of time
        , or you might want life insurance just until your children are grown and
        self supporting . Maybe you want to have life insurance for whenever you die
        , be it next year or when you 're 90 . The third key factor is your budget
        . You might like the idea of a large permanent life insurance policy , but
        the premium may simply be more than you can reasonably afford . So in order
        to determine how much life insurance costs per month , you need to figure
        out how much life insurance you need , how long you need it and what your
        budget allows . By going through this process you can determine how much the
        proper life insurance policy for you will cost .
      - Getting life insurance on your children is a way of ensuring that they can
        have life insurance when they are adults . While many health conditions are
        being rated more favorably by life insurance companies due to improvements
        in medical treatments , I also see fewer and fewer choices for young people
        with serious health conditions . Purchasing life insurance on your children
        while they are healthy is a simple and inexpensive way to give them the security
        of life insurance for the rest of their lives . Whether you get them Whole
        Life , Term insurance that they can convert to permanent insurance later on
        , or just put them on a child rider that they can change to 5 times that amount
        in permanent insurance when they become an adult , each option provides this
        chance to have life insurance for life even if a health condition has developed
        along the way .
      - As stated , voluntary Term is offered on group policies and is voluntary ,
        meaning you do not have to take it . Term insurance means that it is only
        offered for a specific period . Never rely on voluntary term as your whole
        insurance package . This only covers you while you are employed . That is
        why it is called term insurance . Some contracts will allow you to convert
        it to a permanent policy if you leave your job but that would be at a much
        higher rate . Most however do not offer that option . Some individual health
        policies also offer voluntary term insurance . This covers you while you have
        that policy but you lose it if you change insurance companies . You are better
        off in most cases to purchase insurance on your own .
      - The BEST life insurance product is the one that meets your needs . Therefore
        , you must ask yourself ; What is the goal ??? Term and Permanent insurance
        are two different products for two completely different needs . Term insurance
        is a product for just that , a fixed term , with either a level premium for
        the selected term or an increase annual payment if you were to choose renewable
        term . Since the contract isfor a fixed period of time , premiums are typically
        a portion of what the same coverage would be with a Permanent product as there
        are no cash accumulation or surrender features , making it affordable for
        those who need it . Regardless , term insurance is great for those with a
        need for coverage in the event of a loss of life , for a fixed term , i.e.
        the income or performance of the insured will be relied on by others . Additionally
        , term insurance is a great way for families with a limited income , to protect
        and provide for the family and young children in the event of the loss of
        the family breadwinner or equally important , the caregiver -LRB- many ``
        breadwinners '' undervalue the benefit provided by the stay-at-home spouse
        and over look childcare costs ! -RRB- which will help with living and education
        expenses for the surviving family . In the future , these young families can
        always re-analyze goals and needs and when their income allows , and convert
        to a permanent product . Term is also very useful for businesses to protect
        themselves against the loss of production and revenue in the event of a death
        of a key employee . This type of insurance planning called Key-man coverage
        , is cost affordable when using term insurance . Lastly , many of the attractive
        riders that are issued with permanent life policies can also be issued with
        term policies . Permanent insurance is a product with virtually infinite uses
        depending on your needs . Permanent life insurance products are just that
        , permanent for the life of the insured , so long as the owner has paid a
        sufficient amount of premium to maintain the coverage . In comparison to term
        , permanent life insurance is more expensive in order to account for the cost
        of insurance in later years of the insureds life . However , there are multiple
        advantages to buying permanent coverage as soon as you can afford it when
        you are younger . Aside from a lower level premium amount to carry the policy
        to maturity , more time will allow for a larger accumulation of cash value
        in the policy . This cash value , accumulating at a tax-deferred rate that
        beats current treasuries , can also be accessed through policy loans and withdrawals
        in the event of emergency cash needs , can be used as collateral for business
        or personal loans and can also be used to support you during retirement ,
        assuming that the need for coverage has been reduced . There are two main
        forms of permanent coverage , Whole Life products and Universal Life products
        , each with their own attractive features including dividends , increasing
        death benefit , flexible premiums and crediting rates indexed to stock market
        performances . Before making the decision to purchase either , be sure to
        sit down for a -LSB- typically free -RSB- consultation with a licensed life
        insurance agent who will help you identify both your short term and longer
        term needs and goals . Together , you should be able to put together an effective
        plan that will blend affordability and proper protection to meet your life
        insurance needs .
      - Not all term life insurance policies are created equal . You must confirm
        that the policy allows for conversions to a permanent policy and the length
        of time the policy allows you to convert . Keep in mind that the life insurance
        company may limit their permanent life insurance policies to designated contracts
        and not their full inventory . Unfortunately many permanent products are not
        competitive , so its very important in your purchasing decision for term life
        insurance to also consider the companys permanent product inventory in the
        event that you need to convert .
      - If you are asking the question how long the proceeds will last to the survivors
        at your death , that answer is dependent on what you want the life insurance
        to pay for or fund at your death and the amount of money a surviving spouse
        or child will need each month after you have passed on . If you are asking
        the question regarding life insurance products , whole life is designed to
        last to age 99 . Term life insurance will expire at the end of the policy
        term if not renewed or converted . Keith Prim - Dallas , TX 214-435-0791
      - It depends on the type of life insurance . Term is pure coverage meaning you
        are covered for the length of time the term is meant to cover . If you get
        a 10 year term , you are covered up to the 10 years . Most terms are convertible
        to a permanent policy , but most have a conversion period so be sure to read
        the life contract . Other forms of life such as whole and universal life are
        meant to cover the insured until death , but you have to make sure that you
        have paid enough in for the policy not to lapse . The outline of the plan
        should be in your life contract .
      - You may never have a reason to cancel Term Life Insurance . If you are paying
        a reasonable rate but no longer need the coverage , you might consider changing
        your beneficiary to a charity or grandchild . You can even convert your Term
        insurance to Permanent so that the policy never ends . If you got your policy
        at a young age and in good health , you will never get rates like that again
        , so think twice before you cancel it . You may even find that a relative
        is willing to help pay your premiums for you to keep or convert it , so that
        they do not have to worry about how to pay for your final expenses when you
        pass .
      - 'What is the best Whole Life Policy ? While there is no direct answer to this
        , the best answer is whatever policy will best protect your family . There
        are different types of whole life policies . The most common is ordinary whole
        life , also called `` straight Life '''' or `` Permanent '''' -LRB- cash value
        -RRB- Insurance . You pay a level premium for the rest of your life , as long
        as you are making your monthly premiums . The premium never increases and
        your policy accumulates cash value . How much life insurance -LRB- death benefit
        -RRB- will you need ? That determines on a number of factors such as : Do
        you have any children/grandchildren you want to leave money to ? How much
        of your income does your spouse depend on ? Who depends on you financially
        ? How much debt do you owe ? Do you want to leave money to your favorite charity
        ? You want to make sure you buy enough life insurance to cover your financial
        obligations if an unexpected or untimely death occurs . It is also important
        your premium fit ''s within your budget . Because if you ca n''t afford it
        , it is n''t any good for you or your family . An insurance agent is the best
        person to get with to compare the different types of life insurance and find
        a policy that best suits your situation . I work with many top insurance carriers
        with the most competitive rates . I ''ll do the shopping for you ! Thank you

      - A conversion credit is a discount on premiums due on a permanent life insurance
        policy upon conversion . For example , if you have a term life insurance policy
        that has a $ 500 annual premium and to convert the policy to a permanent policy
        that has a premium if $ 5,000 per year , you will only owe the insurance company
        $ 4,500 in the first year you convert providing the insurance company offers
        a credit equal to the annual term premium . Credits are typically offered
        only in the year of conversion and generally are the amount of one year 's
        worth of term insurance premium .
      labels:
      - How do you convert a term policy to whole life ? The best way is to contact
        your agent or if you do n't have one , the company directly and they will
        assign you one . Usually a conversion is nothing more than filling out a single
        page . For a lot of people this is great deal because you no longer have to
        prove your health . So if your health is bad conversion is a great idea .
      - Most term life insurance policies have a convertible provision to permanent
        life insurance or in most cases whole life . This is a great feature for those
        who now have health issues which could cause them not to get a good rate on
        life insurance or even uninsurable all together . I would contact your agent
        . It may make sense to convert all or part of your term to perm . If you are
        still in good health it may make better sense to purchase whole life new and
        replace the old term policy . In most cases convertible term is not the most
        affordable option if health is not an issue . Your term life carrier is assuming
        risk with conversion and that does come at a price . Just be sure to weigh
        all of your options before converting . Good luck !
      - First , `` converting '' a Term policy to Whole Life is n't what it sounds
        like . In most cases there is a time limit by which you must `` convert ''
        otherwise you loose the one benefit of this kind of conversion . Some , -LRB-
        very few -RRB- , providers will actually credit a small amount of what has
        been paid into the Term policy to the new Whole Life policy as long as you
        're converting with the same provider . When `` converting '' from Term to
        Whole Life within the allotted time frame , the one benefit that is being
        `` converted '' to the new policy is the `` classification '' of the insured
        . In other words if the classification was `` Preferred '' or `` Standard
        '' , -LRB- whatever the classification was -RRB- , with the Term policy ,
        that same classification will be given to the new policy without having to
        have another medical exam or underwriting . But the premium for the new policy
        will be adjusted to the attained age of the insured as well as the benefit
        amount . So how do you go about converting your Term to a Whole Life ? Contact
        your agent or the provider , let them know that 's what you would like to
        do . You may be able to or you may not be able to . In either case you most
        likely will loose any money paid into the Term policy .
      - That is a great question ! Your policy should have a clause that outlines
        the details of your conversion process , but here 's what you want to do .
        If you purchased the policy through an agent , contact them and let them know
        what you are wanting to do . They will then tell you if your policy is convertible
        , and if so what that conversion will buy for you in a whole life policy .
        You should be aware that your coverage amount will be much lower , and if
        you want to keep the face value that your premiums will become much more expensive
        . Whole life policies are more expensive than term policies are because of
        their cash accumulation features , and the higher risk to the insurer - they
        do n't have to pay out on many term policies , but have to pay out on nearly
        every whole life one . Decide where your budget allows , and what minimum
        coverage you want to keep , and have your agent work with you on getting as
        close to those numbers as possible.I think the conversion is a great idea
        . If you have questions , please do n't hesitate to contact me , okay ? Thanks
        for asking !
      - Such a conversion may be possible so long as your term policy includes such
        a provision . Talk to your Insurance Professional about your contract and
        whatever options and benmefits may be included in it . In many cases , you
        may find that you can convert all or a portion of your term coverage into
        whole life or other form of permanent life insurance . In many cases , this
        conversion benefit also states that you can do so without having to provide
        any proof of `` insurability '' , in other words , without any physical exam
        or reports by your Doctor being needed . Understand that if available , the
        conversion would take place at your current age and the rates applied accordingly
        so the younger you are when you decide to take advantage of this option ,
        the better off financially you will be .
      - 'Converting Term to Permanent Insurance requires several things : 1 -RRB-
        Your policy must offer that provision ; 2 -RRB- You must take advantage of

        , and other features offered by that carrier , a knowledgeable agent can get
        you the most bang for your buck . E.g. . If you are in good health or still
        want Term insurance , you may be better off getting a new policy . If you
        are in poor health , you may be able to save money by converting to a policy
        guaranteed not to lapse for a limited number of years , rather than paying
        for a lifetime guarantee . Conversions are easy to execute but can be complicated
        to decide , so having a consumer driven agent in your corner can really help

      - Knowing the disadvantages of all financial assets is a good idea , so good
        for you to check ! All financial assets have their issues . The key to financial
        success is to determine which ones fit your financial situation the best and
        how to assemble an overall mix of assets that serves you best . Annuities
        often have a place in a portfolio even with their limitations . You would
        think your question would be easy to answer . The true , but maybe not too
        satisfying answer is , it depends on how it is used . Annuities are a tool
        and when used well they can yield excellent results . If used poorly they
        can be hazardous to your financial health . This is a deep topic so I will
        just list a few things to look out for to determine if an annuity is appropriate
        for you . I would advise you to ask your friends for a referral to a reputable
        insurance professional . And I would look to your CPA or tax advisor to advise
        you on the tax implications of owning an annuity . This is best done in a
        joint meeting of both the insurance professional and the tax advisor . Are
        you under 59 and 1/2 and subject to the IRS 10 % early withdrawal penalty
        How liquid is the annuity ? How long do the early withdrawal penalties work
        and how much will they let you take out annually without penalty ? Can you
        afford to defer your gains and let them grow past the penalty periods ? Is
        there a market value adjustment cost in addition to the early withdrawal penalty
        ? How is the interest rate calculated ? How long are current rates locked
        in ? Will the credited interest rate go up with rising interest rates ? How
        financially strong is the insurance company you are looking at ? Are you confident
        they will be able to deliver on their contractual promises ? What are their
        independent ratings ? Annuities require ongoing attention . Are you willing
        to meet with your advisors periodically to manage them ? These and many other
        factors should be considered in determining if an annuity is appropriate for
        you . Competent professionals use annuities to provide safe income , growth
        and tax benefits . They are useful in many situations . Be mindful that they
        are only one of many tools a financial professional may use in helping their
        clients ' meet their financial goals .
      - A variable annuity has features that make it an attractive purchase . A variable
        annuity is often seen as a hedge against the ravages of inflation . The time
        to buy a variable annuity is when you want to establish a long term savings
        program . Normally the objective of the program would be to accumulate money
        for retirement . You would consider a variable annuity if you were dissatisfied
        with the return offered on other annuities . The final consideration is to
        evaluate your risk tolerance to determine if a variable annuity is the correct
        contract for you . In order to purchase a variable annuity you must deal with
        a registered representative who holds a variable annuity license in your state
        . This agent receives additional supervision for your safety . This agent
        will provide you with a prospectus for any fund available in the variable
        annuity The primary feature or a variable annuity is that the contract is
        an annuity . An annuity can provide an income that you can not outlive . This
        feature can be different in various variable annuities but the fact that a
        lifetime income is available is extremely important . Another feature that
        would make a variable annuity attractive is that there isnt any taxation on
        gain during the accumulation period of the annuity . The gain is reinvested
        inside the annuity and this compounding effect is very important . A variable
        annuity unlike other annuities is not based upon interest , rather it is based
        upon the performance of underlying investment accounts which you may tailor
        to suit your specific needs and interests . You are normally granted the right
        to transfer between investment options without triggering income taxes . Many
        of these transfers also avoid any fees . There are risks associated with investing
        in a variable annuity , including loss of principal . A variable annuity is
        flexible . It can be changed throughout the accumulation period to meet your
        specific requirements . You risk tolerance can change over time . The variable
        annuity will allow you to change the mix of investments held by the variable
        annuity . If you become apprehensive about the market , there is almost always
        a fixed account to provide steady interest without fear of loss . There are
        fees associated with a variable annuity that are not always found in other
        annuities . These fees reflect the fact that the value of the annuity is invested
        , rather than merely earning interest . There are opportunities in most variable
        annuities to shift from fund to fund and to shift from variable funds to fixed
        funds . Normally there arent any fees for this service . Like most annuities
        surrender fees may be applicable . This is because of the long term nature
        of the contract and can be understood when compared to the early withdrawal
        penalties that are a part of certificates of deposit . These surrender fees
        are often waived in the event of disability . Like other annuities the variable
        annuity allows you to select a beneficiary . Many variable annuities provide
        for a guaranteed minimum death benefit that provides some safeguards for your
        family should you retire before you retire . The death benefit from the annuity
        would pass by contract to the beneficiary in the event of death avoiding probate
        expense and delay . Many variable annuities will return the amount of deposits
        as a death benefit should the value of the annuity be less .
      - A `` single-premium immediate annuity -LRB- SPIA -RRB- '' is an annuity .
        That is to say , an annuity is defined as an income stream that continues
        until the annuitant dies when a person pays a lump sum of money -LRB- single
        premium -RRB- to an insurance company in exchange for that income stream -LRB-
        annuity -RRB- . So , the term `` single-premium immediate annuity '' is a
        bit redundant . Think of it as taking retirement money from a privately funded
        pension , except that , in this case , you are funding it with a one-time
        , lump-sum of money.The important thing to remember is that once you pay the
        single premium , that money is essentially `` gone '' . You have just `` purchased
        '' an income that you can not outlive.There are all sorts of ways to design
        the annuity -LRB- stream of income -RRB- . You can get a monthly check , quarterly
        check , annual check - just about any payment schedule you can think of .
        You can also have the annuity pay out completely should you die before the
        original single premium you gave to the insurance company gets paid out .
        Should you choose that option , you will need to name a `` beneficiary ''
        to receive the remainder of the payout.Annuities , in general , are complex
        insurance contracts and space is not provided here to go into all the details
        . But , be absolutely certain that an annuity is right for you before you
        fork over the money because once it is committed to the contract , you either
        ca n't get a refund or there are stiff surrender penalties associated with
        backing out of the deal . Work only with an experienced insurance professional
        that has a solid working knowledge of what annuities are , how they work ,
        and whether or not it is in your best interest to own one . More advanced
        knowledge about annuities can be obtained by consumer-friendly websites online
        .
      - 'Are we talking about fixed or variable ? I ''ll assume fixed , so here goes
        ... Annuities , for a 5 year old : Do you know how a CD works ? An annuity
        is the same thing , just with a longer time until you get your money back
        . CD ''s are issued by banks , Annuities are issued by insurance companies
        . Interest from CD ''s are taxed each year while interest from annuities are
        not taxed until you take the money . Does this sound like a retirement account
        ? Yup , the IRS thinks so too . If you take money out before they want you
        to , you ''re penalized 10 % -LRB- stupid government -RRB- . The longer the
        term , the higher the interest you should expect . CD for 12 months = low
        interest Annuity for 10 years = slightly more interest . Were you referring
        to variable annuities ? Think mutual fund account with higher fees -LRB- generally
        -RRB- . Now , riders ... no 5 year old would ever understand these ... except
        income riders . Here ''s the deal : You get X percent of the balance of the
        account , paid to you for the rest of your life ... even if the account balance
        is $ 0.00 . What ? I still get paid when there ''s no money left ? Yup ! That
        , my 5 year old friend , is an annuity -LRB- with an in come rider -RRB- .
        There ''s a lot more to it than that . I could write a book on annuities -LRB-
        and many people have -RRB- . Make sure you work with a competent advisor who
        can speak your language . If they keep babbling about terms you do n''t understand
        , move on and find someone else to work with .'
      - The most important concept to understand when it comes to retirement planning
        is that it is a process of shifting consumption . The decision that must be
        made is how much am I going to consume today and how much do I need tomorrow
        . In todays low interest environment this question is easier to understand
        . In order to have $ 100 a month in retirement , I have to defer consumption
        of a certain amount today , depending upon my age and years to retirement
        . Once it is clear in our minds that retirement planning isnt about beating
        the stock market , winning a jackpot , or winning a national lottery , we
        can address the issue of how to shift those funds that represent our deferred
        consumption . The best place to start is with an advisor who will listen to
        you and communicate clearly with you . That advisor will be careful to measure
        your risk tolerance . The advisor doesnt want you staying awake at night worrying
        about losing money in your retirement plan , which is what happened to many
        in 2008 . The advisor will ask a battery of questions that measure your expectations
        and compares that with your willingness to experience loss . Eventually a
        picture will emerge that will give the advisor a snapshot of your current
        thinking about investing . The good adviser will continue reviewing your risk
        tolerance throughout the period of time that investment advice is being given
        . The advisor will take that information and compile recommendations of funds
        that would be suitable to help you meet your objectives and yet are sufficiently
        diversified to offer a degree of protection for the assets that you will invest
        . The adviser will offer you choices . He may suggest that these assets be
        held in a variable annuity . The annuity has certain features that might be
        important to you . The variable annuity will frequently feature both fixed
        and variable options . The variable annuity will usually allow you to shift
        assets as your risk tolerance changes . For example , at age 60 after several
        years of having a variable annuity , you might experience a windfall , perhaps
        a legacy . You might want to become more aggressive with your variable annuity
        . You will be able to shift funds to accomplish this change easily . If later
        reverses make you more tentative , you can return your funds into fixed or
        very conservative options . This ability to shift is an important feature
        of the variable annuity . Ultimately the results of the annuity will be a
        function of the options which you select . While that might seem daunting
        , in fact , if you selected funds in your comfort zone you will most likely
        be pleased with the results . The main point is the process of shifting those
        dollars from current consumption to future consumption . When you start spending
        them you will not remember how much of a return you made in a given year .
        The variable annuity also has the benefit of being an annuity . That means
        that you can select to receive your money in retirement as a life-long stream
        of income . The return on such an annuity can be remarkably high . The company
        will probably offer alternative distribution plans to meet your specific needs
        . There will probably be a survivor option so that your spouse could receive
        the balance of payments if you dont reach a specified age or havent exhausted
        the initial fund . Some companies that issue variable annuities will allow
        you to continue to manage your money in the annuitization process . Then the
        results wont be guaranteed and can rise and fall with the values of the underlying
        securities .
      - There are two basic classifications of annuities , immediate and deferred
        . The immediate annuity provides income payments over the lifetime of the
        annuitant starting within one year of the deposit . The deferred annuity doesnt
        start payments until a later date . Deferred annuities may increase in value
        over time . That increase is not subject to income tax as it occurs . This
        deferral of taxation is a major attraction of annuities . A deferred annuity
        can be either a single premium annuity or a flexible annuity . As a single
        premium annuity it is often used to augment retirement income at a later date
        , when other streams of income may have ceased . It is often used to anticipate
        increases in inflation , providing a much needed boost in income . As a flexible
        deferred annuity the contract allows the owner to make deposits on either
        a scheduled or unscheduled basis into the policy . As mentioned previously
        earnings on the contract are not taxed in the years that the money is accumulating
        . A deferred annuity can be classified into three major groups . The first
        would be the fixed annuity , the second would be the variable annuity and
        the third would be the indexed annuity . The fixed annuity is issued by an
        insurance company . The owner makes at least one deposit and everything that
        takes place later is the responsibility of the insurance company . The company
        guarantees the growth and guarantees the future payments . There isnt any
        market risk in this policy . A variable annuity , while structured similarly
        by the insurance company that issues it , allows that the owner can select
        the funds that will accumulate to provide future benefits . In some cases
        it may extend the privilege of selecting underlying funds into the annuitization
        phase which will result in uneven results but has the potential of exceptional
        growth . An index annuity lies somewhere in between . The index annuity is
        designed by the insurance company but rather than paying a guaranteed rate
        of interest , bases interest payments on the performance of one of the leading
        market indicators . Commonly these policies are linked to the Dow Jones Average
        or the Standard and Poors index . The annuity has restrictions on the amount
        of interest credited . The interest rate can either be capped at a preset
        percentage or the policy can be written so that only a percentage of the rate
        is applied to the money in the annuity . The trade-off comes when the company
        guarantees a minimum rate of interest . That minimum rate is often 0 % . What
        this means is that the annuity can participate somewhat in the increases experienced
        in the stock market without the risk of losing anything . This is quite attractive
        and currently very popular . An aspect of all annuities that is often overlooked
        is that they are not subject to probate . That means that as a contract the
        value of the annuity passes to a designated beneficiary without the expensive
        and time consuming process known as probate . Taxation of annuities is another
        subject but it is important to know where the annuity is going to be held
        to determine its taxation .
      - 'In Canada annuities there are two main types of annuities : accumulation
        annuities and payout annuities . If they are issued by an insurance company
        they can/do include maturity & death benefit guarantees , potential creditor
        proofing , estate bypass -LRB- privacy and costs -RRB- and more . They are
        used extensively by retirement and estate planners . The topic of annuities
        with all our industry jargon is indeed confusing . Experience has taught me
        that an understanding the basics is the key step . 1 . An accumulation annuity
        is as the name suggests is used to save money , a payout annuity option is
        included as part of the contract . There are two main types of accumulation
        annuities : Guaranteed Interest Annuity -LRB- GIA -RRB- - principle is guaranteed
        and interest is earned similar to a GIC Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIF
        -RRB- - similar to a mutual fund , the principle is at risk , however , with
        maturity and death benefit guarantees , etc. . In Canada , they are also referred
        to a segregated funds or variable annuities . 2 . Payout Annuities , you exchange
        a sum of money for a flow of income . There are many variations with different
        guarantees but the basic two types are : Annuity certain , where in exchange
        for a lump sum of money you receive a guaranteed income for a specified number
        of years . Life annuity , where in exchange for a lump sum of money you receive
        a guaranteed income for the rest of your life or with a joint life . These
        are usually purchased with a guarantee payment period . The more guarantees
        , the lower the income . To understand an annuity , first understand a mortgage
        . With a mortgage you receive a lump sum of money and pay back principal and
        interest over a specified term until the balance is zero . With a payout annuity
        certain you are at the opposite side of the equation , you exchange a lump
        sum of money for a guaranteed income stream for a specified term . You will

      - Annuity companies are required to invest the majority of their portfolios
        in bonds . They do have flexibility to invest in bonds that are rated high
        or low . If a high-grade bond is AAA rated , it will provide a lower return
        to the annuity company . If the annuity company is willing to invest in lower
        rated bonds , the return will be high because of the increased risk . Annuity
        companies also have the flexibility to invest in bonds with different maturity
        schedules . This can have an impact on your annuity renewal rate based on
        when you purchased your annuity and the timing as the bond market moves up
        and down over time . Annuity rates have recently dropped and while nobody
        has a crystal ball to know exactly where rates are going , here 's an approach
        you can think about and see if it addresses your concern . You can use what
        is called a `` ladder '' approach . Take the total amount of what you intend
        to put into an annuity and split it into 3 or 4 pieces . Purchase one annuity
        now with 1/3 or 1/4 of your total amount . Wait one or two years and do the
        same with the next 1/3 or 1/4 . Using this strategy can be effective during
        a time when annuity rates will be climbing . Of course , if annuity rates
        drop , it can work the other way . Remember , you always have the option not
        to purchase a 2nd or 3rd annuity if the interest rates are not to your liking
        . Using the laddered approach does leave the question as to what you do with
        the remaining funds during your `` wait and see '' time . That lost time can
        be a drawback if you 're just going to let your money sit in a bank CD which
        typically earns only a fraction of what an annuity can provide . Speak with
        a qualified retirement income professional that can look at your particular
        situation and help determine the best course of action for you .
      - Annuities are used for retirement as a source of regular income . Your annuity
        is tax deferred until you take out payments . The contributions you put into
        an annuity are not taxed , and the earnings are taxed at your tax rate during
        retirement . Therefore , they can be a tax favorable way of earning supplemental
        income during retirement . If you take out an immediate annuity , you contribute
        a lump sum and can begin to take out regular payments nearly immediately .
        A deferred annuity allows you to make payments into it over a number of years
        , then annuitize the annuity to receive regular payments . These payments
        are generally used to add to Social Security benefits and other income during
        retirement . Variable annuities make your annuity more of an investment ,
        with the risks that come with variable products . Indexed annuities also allow
        for more growth but protect the original contribution .
      - What happens to an annuity upon death depends on the type of annuity you have
        and the contractual stipulations . If you have an annuity that was set up
        to pay out for the rest of your life , there may be not benefit paid upon
        your death . Some Life Annuities will return what was paid in or pay for a
        guaranteed number of years . A Joint with Last Survivor Annuity will continue
        payments to the spouse . For annuities that will are set up to pay a fixed
        number of years , annuity payments will continue to the beneficiaries just
        as if they did before . If the annuity was not yet annuitized , the proceeds
        must be received by the beneficiaries within 5 years . Contact your agent
        or the company through which your annuity was secured to understand the specifics
        about your particular contract .
      - 'Before defining Variable Annuities , it is important to have an understanding
        about annuities in general . Immediate guaranteed annuity - in exchange for
        a lump sum the insurance company will pay a guaranteed amount for the rest
        of your life , -LRB- with or without a minimum payout guaranteed -RRB- or
        for a specified term or duration . Easy way to understand it is like a mortgage
        in reverse - you give lump sum and get income in return . Immediate variable
        annuity - in exchange for a lump sum you receive an income as above , all
        or part of the income amount depends on the performance of a pool of funds
        or an index chosen by you . Deferred annuity - you deposit fund with an insurance
        company and the funds are invested and you have guaranteed annuity amount
        or an option to receive at maturity -LRB- depending on what you had chosen
        -RRB- . Variable deferred annuity - In Canada , these are typically called
        segregated funds and are similar to mutual funds , but since they are issued
        by insurance companies , they have guarantees at maturity and death.The amount
        of the investment will vary depending on the performance of the funds chosen
        and can be converted into a immediate annuity at maturity . This is a very
        simple overview of a potentially complex subject and you should not take any
        action before discussing with a licensed professional . If you have further
        questions , or feel that I could be of assistance , please do not hesitate
        to contact me . If you would like to work with a local life insurance broker

      - Most carriers will only issue a policy for a face amount equal to or less
        than the amount of coverage you have on your spouse . So you 've got to think
        about how much coverage your spouse has , what debts you need/want paid off
        , do you need it for income replacement , . etc. . Many people think that
        if their spouse does not produce an income , then they do not need coverage
        . This is the wrong way to look at it . Just because a spouse may be a stay-at-home
        mom or dad , does n't mean they do n't need coverage . In many homes , a stay-at-home
        spouse often maintains the house , the yard , buys the groceries , cooks ,
        etc. . If the spouse passed away , would you do these tasks ? Or would you
        pay to have someone else do them ? Are you going to do them yourself ? All
        of these factor into the decisions . In short , while a stay-at-home spouse
        may not generate income , he/she may greatly reduce personal expenses . How
        much does that total up to over a given number of years ? It 's helpful to
        consult with an experienced broker who can help you determine how much coverage

      - Is long term care insurance really necessary ? The answer depends on you and
        what you want to happen to you in a care situation . If you want a say in
        where you go , how you are treated and what you get to keep asset wise , Long
        Term Care makes great sense . You can certainly do without it , but understand
        you give up where you go , how you 're treated and very little if any choice
        in assets you get to keep . All a long term care policy does is give you control
        over how you 're treated when you need a care situation . So no , it is not
        necessary if that does n't matter to you . If it does , then it makes great
        sense . Long term care is an either you get it or you do n't product . Most
        purchasers of long term care WANT the product , very few have to be talked
        into making a purchase . It is one the few products in insurance where you
        spend a lot of time plugging together options for people as they 've already
        decided to purchase , so the question becomes what do they want it to do ?
      - 'Video Transcript : Today ''s question is : What does term life insurance
        cover ? Remember first of all , if we ''re using term , it only covers that
        period in time . If you buy a 20-year term , as an example , it ''s only going
        to cover you for 20 years . If you buy $ 1/2 million dollars of death benefit
        , you ''ll have it for as long as you pay your premiums on time ; you ''ll
        have that coverage . What is it good for ? How does it cover ? It ''s going
        to cover anything that you think that you need . Let ''s say , at $ 1/2 million
        , you had a mortgage at $ 250,000 , you had credit card debt , you had car
        debt , you had educational debt . You want to cover that so that your spouse
        or your beneficiaries will not be actually saddled with your debt if something
        happened to you . When I ''m looking at , ` What does term life insurance
        ? '' it ''s the time zone , how long do I have , what obligations would I
        have , and how can I relieve my beneficiaries from any of those obligations
        if something happens to me ?'
      - This is an outstanding question ! It goes to the heart of how best to protect
        your family , and sort through all of the choices out there . It can be scary
        trying to figure out who has the ` best deal ' and since most people do n't
        understand a lot about insurance , how not to get taken . I think it is fair
        to say also that people do n't have a high opinion of insurance to begin with
        , so agents are n't seemingly much better . So why not just choose a policy
        from an on-line company or name brand company ? Here 's what I 'd say to you
        . I have always done business as much by my feel for the person as by their
        product . If my server does n't care about me or my meal , I do n't go back
        to the restaurant , or I only order carryout from them . If a bagger at the
        grocery store just throws my groceries haphazardly into the bags , I 'll look
        for a different line every time . I want to know that the person I 'm dealing
        with cares about me , and my business . I also want to know that I have some
        flexibility - if they 're the only bagger or server , I wo n't go back to
        those places . An independent agent can offer more options than a name brand
        office agent would . The name brand can only offer that companies policies
        , and prices . If their policy is the best one , and I feel the agent truly
        cares about me and my needs , I 'll buy from them . Chances are though , I
        've met with at least one other independent agent -LRB- one not tied to a
        single brand name - I myself work with several -RRB- to shop prices and coverage
        before deciding . Again , how they presented themselves to me as they worked
        for my business was as much a consideration for me as the policy details .
        If I did n't feel like they cared about anything but the sale , I 'd leave
        , and thank them for their time . When the time comes that I need help -LRB-
        and it inevitably does -RRB- I want someone who cares and jumps to help ,
        not someone who has to hunt to figure out who I am . i guess for me , I want
        a relationship with my business people , -LRB- and my clients -RRB- not just
        a transaction . I hope that helps you , and I thank you for asking !
      - 'The challenge to answering the question `` Will annuities increase ? ''''
        is that the answer depends on the context of the question . I will provide
        an answer for different situations and if you would like further clarification
        you can contact me . In Canada , there are basically two type of annuities
        , immediate and deferred . Immediate annuities provide an income in exchange
        for a lump sum . With a deferred annuity , the income is in the future , Deferred
        annuities are often used as an accumulation or investment vehicle . When the
        investment options are guaranteed , it is similar to a guaranteed investment
        certificate , GIC , and could increase through interest growth . In Canada
        , variable deferred annuities are often referred to as segregated funds or
        seg funds . These are similar to mutual funds and their value can increase
        or decrease depending on the fund -LRB- s -RRB- performance . Since they are
        issued by insurance companies , seg funds do offer minimum death and maturity
        guarantees , typically 75 % or 100 % . Some companies also offer resets or
        the locking in of gains , the full details of which are outlined in the plan
        ''s information folder . One major factor in determining the income provided
        from immediate guaranteed annuities is long term interest rates . If rates
        increase , the amount of income provided will also increase . The income from
        an immediate annuity can also increase after issue depending on the terms
        of the contact . An indexed annuity for example can provide for an increase
        in income each year . Another option would have part of the income dependent
        on the performance of a fund or pool of funds , where the income would increase
        or decrease depending on the funds '' performance . This is a basic overview
        of a potentially complex subject . Do not take any action without consulting
        a licensed professional . If you have further questions , or feel that I could
        be of assistance , please do not hesitate to contact me . If you would like
        to work with a local life insurance broker , you could start with a Google
        search . For example , if you search for : life insurance broker Halifax or
        life insurance agent Halifax , my name , along with several others , will
        come up . You can use the same method to find a life insurance broker in your
        community .'
      - In Canada , immediate and deferred annuities are , with one exception , taxed
        on an accrual basis . The growth or income is taxed as earned , not as received
        . How the income is taxed , depends , if it is interest income or , in the
        case of Guaranteed Investment Fund -LRB- GIFs -RRB- , interest , dividends
        or capital gains . Prescribed Annuities enjoy special taxation -LRB- Section
        304 of Income Tax Act -RRB- . They are taxed on a straight line basis rather
        than on an accrual basis . If you qualify for a prescribed annuity then total
        amount of `` expected '' interest is averaged based on the number of payments
        . For example invest in a prescribed life income annuity and your `` life
        expectancy '' is 22 years . The amount of investment DIVIDED BY `` life expectancy
        '' EQUALS return of your principle and it is not taxed . The annuity payment
        SUBTRACT the return of your principle is taxable . The tax savings can be
        substantial , which is why prescribed annuities are often used to increase
        after tax income . Especially for those who prefer guaranteed interest income
        . A life insurance policy can replace the capital for your estate . Depending
        on the the individual circumstances , increases of after tax income can be
        50 % or more . Implementing a strategy involving payout annuities is sometimes
        complicated , it is however , always permanent . Search for Retirement / Financial
        planner in your area . Then look for an experienced life insurance broker
        with a professional designation such as a CLU or CFP . If you have further
        questions , or feel that I could be of assistance please contact me .
      - 'There are two basic types of annuities : immediate and deferred . With an
        immediate annuity , you exchange a lump sum for an immediate income . This
        is often used as retirement income . All , or part of , the income received

        the performance of the fund or funds you have selected . A deferred annuity
        is an accumulation plan that provides the option of an income annuity in the
        future . In Canada unit linked or variable annuities are called segregated
        funds or seg funds . They are similar to mutual funds and their value will
        increase or decrease based on performance . Since they are issued by insurance

      - A medigap policy is also known as a Medicare Supplement policy . These policies
        are issued by a number of insurance companies in response to the out of pocket
        expenses that are not covered by Medicare , part A and Part B . A medigap
        policy is almost necessary for all Medicare participants . There can be massive
        out-of-pocket expenses in Medicare and the money that could be provided by
        the plan far outweigh the cost of the plan . These plans were developed by
        private companies . In response to the wide variety of policies developed
        the federal government decided to regulate these policies in the 1980s . The
        desire was to provide uniformity of benefits . There are ten different medigap
        policies available . They are referenced by letters A , B , C , D , F , G
        , K , L , M and N. Although these plans can change from time to time they
        have maintained these designations . Companies are not required to identify
        their policy by these letters and will often introduce stylized names such
        as Senior Select Medigap policy . It is most important to understand that
        all of the plans must contain core benefits . As they add additional benefits
        they must fall into one of the letter categories . This helps to compare plans
        and to insure that your needs are properly covered . You can enroll in a medigap
        policy during certain periods . During those periods the policy is guaranteed
        to be issued without medical underwriting . If the policy is desired after
        the set period medical underwriting can be required and the premium can be
        altered . The open enrollment period begins on the first day of the month
        in which you reach age 65 or older and enroll in Medicare Part B . This enrollment
        period continues for six months . People who are disenrolling from Medicare
        Advantage can receive a guaranteed issued medigap policy for 12 months when
        they enroll in traditional Medicare . There are other circumstances under
        which a person would be eligible for a Medigap policy without providing evidence
        of insurance . There are five core benefits contained in every medigap plan
        . The first is that the plan will pay the Medicare Part A copayments for days
        61-90 . These copayments were $ 289 per day of hospitalization in 2012 . Another
        core benefit is Medicare Part A lifetime reserve copayments for days 91-150
        . These copayments are $ 578 per day in 2012 . Another core benefit is up
        to 365 additional days of hospital stay beyond Medicare coverage . The medigap
        policies also provide cover the Medicare Part B coinsurance . This doesnt
        apply to preventive services , and the first three pints of blood if needed
        . These core benefits comprise an A plan . Subsequent plans offer increased
        benefits which include skilled nursing facility care copayments for days 21-100
        . That cost was $ 144.50 in 2012 . The plan can provide for the Medicare Part
        A hospital deductible . That amount was $ 1184 in 2013 . The plan can provide
        the annual Medicare Part B deductible which was $ 147 in 2013 . Some plans
        include coverage for the Medicare Part B excess charges . Several plans include
        foreign travel emergency coverage . Every plan is priced by the insurance
        company . Sometimes the company offers the plan based upon the community .
        In other cases the pricing is determined by the age at which the plan is initiated
        . In other cases the plan is based on attained age and can increase as the
        policyholder ages . The core benefits can save you a great deal of money .
        Selecting the additional benefits is probably best done with a counsellor
        that you trust .
      - Medicare gap insurance , Medicare supplement insurance , Medigap ... all the
        same . Like Kleenex and tissue , the terms are interchangeable . Original
        Medicare only covers about 80 % of your hospital and outpatient charges .
        Seniors with a healthy bank account may not need or desire to purchase a Medigap
        -LRB- supplement -RRB- plan . While you may be healthy now , your health can
        change at any time . If you are hospitalized 3 times during a calendar year
        for unrelated medical conditions you will have to pay a deductible of $ 1184
        -LRB- 2013 Medicare Part A deductible -RRB- for each admission . Medicare
        Part B outpatient charges can become expensive as well . After you have paid
        the calendar year Part B deductible of $ 147 -LRB- for 2013 -RRB- you are
        responsible for 20 % of the remaining charges not paid by Medicare . An $
        800 CAT scan can leave you owing several hundred dollars . Medigap plan F
        is the easiest to explain . It covers everything approved by Medicare Part
        A and Part B but not paid by Medicare . Plan F covers deductibles , copay
        's , coinsurance . Plan F is the most popular , purchased by about half of
        those who buy Medicare supplement plans . Plan G -LRB- or in some states ,
        D -RRB- is next followed by plan N .
      - I ca n't say that anyone really `` needs '' a Medigap plan but it is a good
        idea . Original Medicare only covers about 80 % of your hospital and outpatient
        charges . Seniors with a healthy bank account may not need or desire to purchase
        a Medigap -LRB- supplement -RRB- plan . While you may be healthy now , your
        health can change at any time . If you are hospitalized 3 times during a calendar
        year for unrelated medical conditions you will have to pay a deductible of
        $ 1184 -LRB- 2013 Medicare Part A deductible -RRB- for each admission . Medicare
        Part B outpatient charges can become expensive as well . After you have paid
        the calendar year Part B deductible of $ 147 -LRB- for 2013 -RRB- you are
        responsible for 20 % of the remaining charges not paid by Medicare . An $
        800 CAT scan can leave you owing several hundred dollars . Your 20 % share
        of Part B expenses has no upper cap . Medicare supplement plan F covers 100
        % of approved Medicare Part A and Part B charges . Do you `` need '' a Medigap
        plan ? Only you can decide , buy for most it is a wise choice .
      - Based on data compiled for health insurance plans in 2014 with the new mandated
        coverage under the Affordable Care Act , the weighted average of a benchmark
        -LRB- silver , or 70 % benefit level -RRB- health insurance plan in Kansas
        is $ 260 ; which is below the $ 328 national weighted average . As for current
        Kansas averages , the 2013 data is not accurately completed and compiled yet
        . But by best estimates of 2013 data , the average premium in Kansas is $
        182 , but does not disclose or reflect benefit levels or type of coverage
        -LRB- the national average benefit level is 78 % -RRB- . So , in conclusion
        , a resident of Kansas can expect to pay on average $ 182 for a health plan
        the remainder of 2013 , and then $ 260 starting 2014 -LRB- a 43 % increase
        from 2013 , which is in line with the national weighted average of overall
        premium increases -RRB- . But , premiums vary widely across the state and
        by county , and by age .
      - As a general rule , Medicare only pays about 80 % of approved Part A and Part
        B claims . The Medicare Part A deductible for 2013 is $ 1184 . If you did
        not have a Medigap plan you would be responsible for paying this before Medicare
        pays a dime . The Medicare Part B deductible for 2013 is $ 147 . This is your
        responsibility unless you had a Medicare supplement plan that pays that deductible
        . After the deductible is satisfied , Medicare pays 80 % of the claim and
        you are responsible for the other 20 % .
      - Some people think Medigap is better than Advantage plans , but you decide
        . Medicare + Medigap allows you to use any doctor , anywhere in the United
        States . Most Advantage plans require you to use their doctors , or else pay
        a penalty . Medicare + Medigap with most plans -LRB- F , G , N -RRB- means
        less than $ 500 out of pocket during the year in most situations . Even with
        Hi F your out of pocket is capped at $ 2110 for 2013 . Advantage means $ 2700
        - $ 6700 out of pocket per year .
      - Well , it depends ... Original Medicare only covers about 80 % of your hospital
        and outpatient charges . Seniors with a healthy bank account may not need
        or desire to purchase a Medigap -LRB- supplement -RRB- plan . While you may
        be healthy now , your health can change at any time . If you are hospitalized
        3 times during a calendar year for unrelated medical conditions you will have
        to pay a deductible of $ 1184 -LRB- 2013 Medicare Part A deductible -RRB-
        for each admission . Medicare Part B outpatient charges can become expensive
        as well . After you have paid the calendar year Part B deductible of $ 147
        -LRB- for 2013 -RRB- you are responsible for 20 % of the remaining charges
        not paid by Medicare . An $ 800 CAT scan can leave you owing several hundred
        dollars . Medicare supplement plan F covers 100 % of approved Medicare Part
        A and Part B charges .
      - Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospitalizations . Once you satisfy the per
        admission deductible -LRB- $ 1184 in 2013 -RRB- Medicare covers essentially
        all of your routine inpatient charges . If you are discharged and then readmitted
        within 30 days for the SAME medical condition you are not charged a new Part
        A deductible . Keep in mind Medicare only covers charges that are medically
        necessary . They will pay for a semi-private room , ICU and in some cases
        a private room when it is prescribed by a doctor for medical reasons . Following
        satisfaction of your hospital deductible , Medicare covers charges for the
        first 60 consecutive days . If your hospital stay is continuous for 60 days
        you are required to pay a per day copay of $ 296 -LRB- in 2013 -RRB- , then
        $ 592 per day -LRB- in 2013 -RRB- for days 91 - 150 .
      - Most people will receive Medicare Part A without paying a premium . If you
        , or your spouse , paid Medicare taxes during your working years you may not
        have to pay a premium for Part A. Others will be required to pay up to $ 441
        in 2013 . The Medicare Part B premium for 2013 for most people is $ 105 .
        If you fail to sign up for Part B when you are first eligible you may be required
        to pay a late enrollment penalty of up to 10 % per year for every year you
        were eligible but failed to sign up . Higher income individuals may pay a
        penalty . In determining your penalty premium , Medicare considers your income
        from prior tax returns -LRB- from 2 years ago -RRB- . The penalty plus base
        premium is graduated based on income and can be as much as $ 335 in 2013 .

        A , B , C , D , F , G , K , L , M , and N -LRB- a high-deductible plan F is
        also available that features a $ 2,140 deductible in 2014 - the trade-off
        being a substantially reduced premium -RRB- . Each plan offers certain benefits
        some more comprehensive than others . Each plan must cover a core set of benefits
        -LRB- also known as the basic benefits -RRB- . The basic benefits are 1 -RRB-
        Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare
        benefits are used up . 2 -RRB- Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3
        -RRB- First 3 pints of blood 4 -RRB- Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment
        There ''s a total of 9 benefits that can be secured . The other 5 benefits
        available under a Medigap plan are : 1 -RRB- Skilled Nursing Facility Care
        coinsurance 2 -RRB- Medicare Part A deductible 3 -RRB- Medicare Part B deductible
        4 -RRB- Medicare Part B excess charges 5 -RRB- Foreign travel emergency -LRB-
        up to plan limits -RRB- Each plan features a different structure , Each plan
        covers a different combination of these 9 benefits -LRB- some of the plans
        feature coinsurance or copayments for certain benefits -RRB- . If cost is
        not a major factor for you , Plan F will be the recommended choice because
        it covers all 9 benefits at 100 % - it ''s the most popular plan by far .
        If you ''re looking to keep your costs down , but still have very comprehensive
        coverage , you may want to look at plans C , G , and N as well . When you
        ''re looking to buy a Medigap plan , you should consult with an independent
        Medigap insurance agent to review the plans in detail to see which one will
        best serve your needs , help you identify all of the carriers offering Medigap
        plans in your zip code , and which one will be able to offer the coverage
        to you at the lowest cost -LRB- the plans are standardized so the biggest
        difference between them is price - the benefits are exactly the same regardless
        of the carrier you have the Medigap plan through -RRB- . I hope the information
        is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap
        coverage needs , including quotes and plan comparisons , and if you have any
        other questions . Thanks very much .'
      - In a way , yes . What 's actually occurring is you 're leaving Medicare Advantage
        to go back to Original Medicare -LRB- Parts A & B -RRB- and adding a Medigap
        plan to that to cover the 20 % of expenses that Original Medicare does not
        . During the annual enrollment period -LRB- AEP - October 15-December 7 -RRB-
        , you would apply for a Medigap plan noting to the carrier your intent to
        disenroll from the Medicare Advantage plan -LRB- you ca n't have both unfortunately
        -RRB- . The effective date for the coverage would be set up as January 1 of
        the following year because your Medicare Advantage plan is set up as a one-year
        contract providing coverage from January 1-December 31 for the year you enrolled
        for . If it 's your first year in a Medicare Advantage plan and you want to
        go back to Original Medicare , you will have a guaranteed-issue right -LRB-
        via a `` trial right '' when it 's your first time in an MA plan -RRB- to
        secure any Medigap plan and can not be declined for any medical reasons .
        Another `` guaranteed-issue '' / `` trial right '' situation is if you dropped
        a Medigap plan to go to Medicare Advantage -LRB- for the first time and you
        've been in the plan for less than one year -RRB- and want to go back to Medigap
        , you can secure the Medigap policy you had before you joined the Medicare
        Advantage Plan , if the same insurance company you had before still offers
        it . If your prior carrier your former Medigap policy was through no longer
        offers that same plan , you can buy either a plan A , B , C , F , K , or L
        from any insurance company offering coverage in your area . For either ``
        trial right '' scenarios , it can be done at any point during the year -LRB-
        not just during AEP -RRB- as early as 60 days before the date your Medicare
        Advantage coverage will terminate and no later than 63 days after it ends
        . It 's best to speak with an independent broker who can shop the case for
        you among many carriers to make sure you 're getting the desired Medigap plan
        at the lowest possible cost since they 're standardized -LRB- the coverage
        is the same for a given Medigap plan regardless of who it 's through - the
        only difference being price -RRB- . Captive agents can only offer plans from
        the carrier work they work for . I hope the information is helpful - please
        feel free to contact me for help with your Medicare insurance coverage , including
        plan quotes and comparisons for Medigap plans , and if you have any other
        questions . Thanks very much .

      - How much supplemental life insurance do you need ? Going to depend on what
        your desires are towards protecting your family in case of your early death
        . So the answer really is how much do you feel you need ? The question I have
        would be if you are healthy , why would you go with a supplemental plan when
        you could qualify for a personal plan that you own and control ? Supplimental
        life is a great deal if you are of questionable health . Usually there are
        few questions and minimal underwriting , which means the product has been
        priced assuming poor health to begin with . Remember more questions means
        lower price . Fewer questions mean they priced the insurance as if you already
        answered `` yes '' to the question .
      - The cost of life insurance can range from a few dollars per month to many
        thousands per month . The real question is how much would it cost you to get
        the proper policy for your situation . In order to find that out you need
        to first determine how much death benefit you need . The best way to calculate
        how much life insurance you need is by doing a comprehensive needs analysis
        . If you are looking for a quick rule-of-thumb , we recommend you carry at
        least ten times your annual income in life insurance . The second factor is
        how long do you think you will need the coverage . You might want life insurance
        to cover your mortgage which will be paid off in a certain period of time
        , or you might want life insurance just until your children are grown and
        self supporting . Maybe you want to have life insurance for whenever you die
        , be it next year or when you 're 90 . The third key factor is your budget
        . You might like the idea of a large permanent life insurance policy , but
        the premium may simply be more than you can reasonably afford . So in order
        to determine how much life insurance costs per month , you need to figure
        out how much life insurance you need , how long you need it and what your
        budget allows . By going through this process you can determine how much the
        proper life insurance policy for you will cost .
      - 'A Personal Auto Policy -LRB- PAP -RRB- generally comes with five coverages
        included in the premium . 1 . Auto Liability ... protects you from claims
        other people make against you arising from auto accidents 2 . Uninsured/Underinsured
        Motorists Liability -LRB- UIM -RRB- ... protects you for claims you make against
        other drivers who do not have insurance or do not have enough insurance 3
        . Medical Payments ... pays money to doctors and hospitals for your medical
        expenses arising out of auto accidents 4 . Collision ... pays for damage to
        your car arising out of auto accidents where you collide with another car
        or object , like a tree . 5 . Comprehensive ... pays for damage to your car
        arising out accidents that are other than collision , for example , flood
        , fire and theft . When you ask , `` How Much Auto Insurance Do I Need ? ''''
        , I ''m assuming you mean # 1 , Auto Liability so I ''ll limit my answer to
        that coverage . In subsequent postings , I ''ll answer how much you need for
        the other coverages . So , how much Auto Liability Insurance do you need ?
        It depends . If you just want to get on the road and be legal about it , in
        New Jersey , the minimum limit of insurance is $ 35,000 for each accident
        . You are also required to purchase Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists Liability
        and Medical Payments and they also have minimum limit requirements . Other
        states have similar minimum limit requirements and they are spelled out at
        each state ''s insurance department website . Minimum limit policies will
        get you on the road , but they are not a smart use of your dollars . Consider
        an auto accident where you strike a Lawyer ''s Mercedes ... his new Mercedes
        . Think $ 35,000 will take care of everything ? I would n''t bet on it . And
        if $ 35,000 is not enough , you ''ll pay personally for a long time . Now
        , if your primary goal is adequate protection for you , your family and your
        assets , you need to take a step back . Liability claims against you arising
        out of the use of an auto is one area you should be concerned about . You
        should also be concerned about liability claims arising out of owning a home
        , operating a boat or a motorcycle or an RV . Liability claims can also arise
        from owning vacation property . You can trigger a claim . Your spouse can
        trigger a claim and your children can trigger a claim . Considering all the
        people in your life who can trigger a claim and all the ways they can do it
        , How much is enough liability insurance ? How much should you buy ? Answer
        : I do n''t know . But I do know EVERY smart insurance consumer , concerned
        about `` how much insurance is enough ? '''' should purchase a $ 1 million
        Personal Umbrella Policy . A Personal Umbrella Policy is a secondary policy
        . Your auto policy , homeowner policy , boat policy , and so on are all primary
        policies . Each primary policy has its own limit of insurance . In the event
        of an accident -LRB- in the home , in the car or on the water -RRB- , you
        have a primary policy to protect you . If the amount of primary insurance
        is not enough to pay a claim , the Personal Umbrella policy adds a million
        dollar cushion . Is a Personal Umbrella policy expensive ? No . A million
        dollar umbrella GENERALLY starts around $ 125 . That ''s $ 125 for $ 1,000,000
        of liability protection you can use over your auto insurance or your homeowner
        insurance or your boat insurance and so on and so on . If there is a better
        deal in the insurance business , I ''m not aware of it . Now if you ''re sold
        on the idea that a Personal Umbrella Policy has merit , we need to return
        to your original question : `` How much Auto Liability Insurance do I need
        ? '''' You need an amount of insurance that satisfies the minimum requirements
        of the Personal Umbrella Policy . For example , if your Personal Umbrella
        Policy requires you have a $ 300,000 Personal Auto Liability Limit , that
        ''s what you need to buy for your auto policy . If the requirement is $ 300,000
        and you have $ 250,000 , there will be a $ 50,000 gap in the event of a serious
        claim . Again , for example , you ''re responsible for a serious auto accident
        . It ends up costing $ 600,000 . Your auto policy will pay $ 250,000 , you
        ''ll have to pay $ 50,000 and then the umbrella will pay the remaining $ 300,000
        . So you can see , you need to buy the correct amount of auto and home insurance
        and the correct amount for any other primary policy so you do n''t have a
        gap in coverage . Can you buy a Personal Umbrella Policy with a limit higher
        than $ 1 million ? You can , but the higher the limit , the greater the scrutiny
        . I hope I ''ve answered your question , but if I have n''t , feel free to
        call , fax or email me .'
      - 'This varies for each person . A lot of variables go into the calculation
        of determining how much life insurance you need , how long you need it , and
        what is an appropriate amount to actually secure . A life insurance calculator
        can help with this . A few things to get you started when calculating out
        what you need and how long you need it for are : 1 -RRB- Do you have a mortgage
        ? If so , how much is left on it and how many more years do you have to go

        expenses for you or a family member you want to pay off -LRB- such as college
        tuition -RRB- 4 -RRB- Income replacement - this is a big one ! A question
        to think about here is how much income would be needed if you died today and
        how long would your family need it to maintain their current lifestyle . An
        experienced life insurance broker can help you with this and make it a much
        smoother , easier process . One thing to also note , a lot of people think
        `` once i ''m retired , I wo n''t need life insurance anymore so I can just
        buy term insurance and let it go when I retire '''' - there are many many
        many reasons why you should have life insurance during your retirement years
        . For example , if you ''re receiving a retirement pension and you die , the
        pension income may stop and not continue onto your spouse -LRB- if you chose
        the pension max option over the survivorship option when you started receiving
        benefits -RRB- - this can also apply to social security income . That ''s
        just one scenario . Please feel free to contact me for help and if you have
        any other questions . Thanks very much .'
      - There really is n't a right answer for this , there is only your answer for
        you . There are numerous software programs that you can plug into and it will
        spit out a number and you can choose to follow that program . Is it correct
        or exact ? Unfortunately the anwer is yes , no or maybe depending on the individual
        . I tend to individualize my approach to `` how much life insurance I need
        ? '' when thinking about how much coverage to get . The first or base level
        of coverage I consider is simply this `` if I did n't wake up tomorrow , how
        much money would put things at $ 0 . ? '' This is my starting point or minimum
        level of coverage I would consider . From there , I would start adding based
        on answers to questions posed like ; Does my spouse work ? Would extra money
        help in a transition to work ? How old are my children ? Do I want to have
        something for college set aside for them ? Who can do for my family what I
        can do if something breaks and I 'm not there ? What would that cost ? If
        the main person who does the childcare passes , how much would I need to help
        with that cost ? You can look at your own situation and bring different questions
        and costs to the mix too ! Then much like the purchase of lumber for a project
        you figure the amount plus 10 % extra for just in case . This may be why some
        just say 5X income or 10X income as answers . The assumption is all those
        questions would be answered and then some . The big thing is do n't let what
        ever number you come up with discourage you from getting life insurance .
        Some is always , always better than none .

      - 'There is no magic way to determining how much insurance you need . A method
        you can use for determining how much life insurance coverage you need is to
        do a simple needs analysis : 1 . Income - How much income do you want to give
        your family and for how long if you died ? 2 . Education - Do you want to
        fund your children ''s education ? 3 . Debt - Do you want to pay of any debt
        -LRB- car loan , mortgage , credit cards -RRB- if you died ? Add those three
        things together and you will have a good idea of how much you would need .'
      - 'The answer to this is very subjective depending upon your situation , but
        I ''ll try to make it a little more simple . The idea has always been that
        , when you retire , your need for life insurance decreases . Today , that
        ''s not always the case . It ''s much more complicated now , but there are
        some universal ideas : What is your need for pure death benefit ? How much
        debt do you have and how long will you have it ? How is your pension , 401
        -LRB- k -RRB- , etc. set up ? Will the income from this be set up in a way
        that can provide both you and a spouse with adequate income should either
        of you die ? If not , how much income do you need to provide in the event
        of your death ? What will your death cost in terms of funeral expenses , taxes
        , and estate settlement ? Do you want to have that provided for ? Do you have
        people or institutions that you want to leave money for ? Will one or both
        of you need special care ? When you answer these questions and have an amount
        in mind , it ''s time to explore how best to go about setting it up the right
        way . I ''m not going to go into the type of insurance or any income you may
        need to offset a shortfall in your retirement . That ''s a much larger discussion
        that I ''ll leave for you and an agent you can trust . He/She will be able

        insurance can be extra insurance that you have above and beyond either your
        group plan at work or individually-purchased life insurance . If you purchased
        this and you need more , some people look at supplemental life insurance to
        augment what they already have . You may want to look at this in 2 ways ''''
        ` Would I like to have more coverage or would I like to have a supplemental
        retirement income plan , an extra cash value contract , that can generate
        withdrawals to basis and policy loans to gain tax-free , as long as I keep
        the policy in force for the life of the policy insured ? '' If I ''m looking
        at it as a supplemental income play or I ''m looking at it as a supplemental
        death benefit , supplemental life insurance can be a great adjunct to what
        I already have , either by group or by my individual purchase .'
      - 'You want to find the structure that is going to be the most suitable to meet
        the needs you want to have covered . There ''s a number of factors that you
        should think about when buying life insurance including : 1 -RRB- Why do you
        need the coverage ? 2 -RRB- How long do you need it ? 3 -RRB- What risk class
        do you qualify for ? -LRB- this is one of the MOST critical items when buying
        insurance because it ''s what determines the premiums for the coverage you
        ''re applying for -RRB- . 4 -RRB- Does the policy provide full coverage -LRB-
        payout whether death occurs by illness or injury - if you die by illness and
        you only have an AD&D policy , then the policy will not pay a death benefit
        -RRB- . 5 -RRB- What is the company ''s financial rating ? - this is a big
        point when you ''re looking at permanent coverage . Work with an experienced
        independent life insurance agent/broker . Doing the research on your own can
        be extremely time consuming and you may not always find the information you
        ''re looking for . Independent brokers have an extensive knowledge of the
        subject matter and know the differences between products that are available
        in the marketplace . Brokers can help you through the entire process from
        start to finish . This includes helping you determine how much coverage is
        suitable to what you need the coverage for and how long you should have it
        in place for through an insurance needs analysis , provide quotes from multiple
        carriers and compare the options with you , track the application while it
        ''s in underwriting and provide assistance on future needs as well . If you

      - 'The best Medicare supplement plan is the one that does everything you need
        and you can afford . If you ca n''t afford the plan , do n''t buy it . If
        the plan does n''t cover what you expect it to , do n''t buy it . All Medicare
        supplement plans with the same letter are identical in every way . Once you
        find a plan that fits your needs and budget , buy it . Do n''t ever pay too
        much , thinking you are getting a better policy . You are n''t . #GeorgiaMedicarePlans'
      - As a big do it yourselfer , the answer is maybe ? It depends on what your
        situation is and how adept you are on gathering information and making a good
        decision from all the information out there . I mean I like to work on my
        cars and trucks . I can do many things myself and feel really good about it
        . However , I do still use my trusted mechanic for the things I simply am
        not good enough to do myself and that way I avoid putting my family at risk
        . As another noted , there are absolutely no price savings in going without
        an agent . The laws in most states prevent any discounting for doing it yourself
        . It never ever hurts to become informed about a product . I have taught my
        son the doctor , how to frame a house , wire a house and have a general understanding
        about construction . He 's a doctor now , and yes , that is fun to say , he
        has learned enough about how to build that when he decides to build , he can
        have a good conversation with a builder and know when to call shenanigans
        or not . By all means it pays to educate yourself , but understand that an
        open mind is required to educate yourself .
      - Is Supplemental Disability Insurance worth it ? That is a great question .
        If you need almost all your income to support your family 's lifestyle and
        home , then it certainly could be worth it for you . Group Disability Insurance
        can end up paying you only 45 % of your income , after taxes , and has restrictive
        features that a Supplemental Disability Insurance policy will expand upon
        . Also , Supplemental Disability Insurance can bump the amount you would get
        paid during a disability to 70 % to 80 % of your income . Finally , Supplemental
        Disability Insurance is generally portable whereas group DI policies generally
        are not portable . So purchasing Supplemental Life Insurance while you are
        still insurable can ensure having Disability coverage for the rest of your
        life .
      - How much renters insurance premiums depend on how much coverage you actually
        would like to carry on your personal items and how much liability protection
        you would like to obtain . Rates can run as low as 100.00 - 300.00 per year
        on average . I recommend you consult a local independent agent and discuss
        your personal needs .
      - That is a great question ! The things that you want to know going in - what
        do I want the insurance to do ? -LRB- cover funeral expenses , leave an income
        , cover expenses , pay estate taxes , etc. -RRB- How long do I need it for
        ? -LRB- short term , or long term goal ? -RRB- How much can I safely afford
        to spend ? -LRB- what you want may not be what you can afford -RRB- For the
        agent , you want to know - how financially stable is your company ? Are you
        independent ? -LRB- a captive agent can only give you quotes from one company
        -RRB- and Who is your insurance with , and why ? I hope that helps ! Thanks
        for asking !
      - Employee supplemental term life insurance is a provision to purchase more
        term life insurance through your group life insurance plan . Usually the employer
        will pay for a certain amount of group term life on the employee and the supplemental
        allows the employee to purchase additional face amount at the employee cost
        . While group term life is a nice perk from an employer a healthy employee
        can purchase term life insurance on their own at a more affordable rate and
        they own the policy . As Ted mentioned , if you leave the company you lose
        your coverage . Whereas if you purchase your own term life policy no one can
        take that coverage away from you unless you stop paying premiums or the term
        expires . It is much more sound protection plan . If you are unhealthy and
        can not qualify for affordable term life insurance , then supplemental term
        life can be the temporary answer to a prayer of having enough life insurance
        protection for your loved ones . Contact an independent life insurance broker
        in order to properly weigh your options .
      - Original Medicare -LRB- Parts A & B -RRB- only cover about 80 % of a senior
        's health care expenses , leaving the insured responsible for the other 20
        % . While 20 % does n't sound like a very big figure , it can add up to a
        nice big medical bill really fast . For example , if you had a procedure done
        that cost $ 10,000 and Medicare paid for 80 % -LRB- $ 8,000 -RRB- , you would
        be responsible for the other $ 2,000 of the bill - how many people can just
        get out their checkbook and write a check for that amount ? That number can
        be a lot higher too . The idea of a Medicare Supplement plan -LRB- commonly
        referred to as a Medigap Plan -RRB- is to cover the gaps in coverage that
        Medicare does n't pay for -LRB- e.g. that other 20 % -RRB- . You pay a monthly
        premium to get these gaps covered so you 're not hit with large bills . The
        resulting major advantage is it allows a senior to create a much , much more
        predictable health care expense structure - and when you 're on a fixed income
        , this is vital . A plan F is the most comprehensive Medicare supplement plan
        available in the marketplace today - plans C , G , and N are very competitive
        as well . I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact
        me for help and if you have any other questions . Thanks very much .
      - Often this question is approached by , how much can you afford ? I would like
        you to think of it as , How much can you afford to lose . I have been driving
        over 50 years . I have had one minor fender bender 46 years ago . Had I never
        purchased insurance -LRB- in California I have the option of posting a bond
        or cash -RRB- I would have saved approximately $ 90,000 . However , a recent
        accident involving a pedestrian struck in a cross walk resulted in a settlement
        of over $ 750,000 . I couldnt have afforded the settlement , so I paid the
        premiums . What can you afford to lose ? Buy the insurance that will protect
        you from those amounts that you can not afford to lose . If you can qualify
        for an umbrella consider limits in the $ 1-2 million range . In our lawsuit
        happy society that is not being overly cautious .
      - 'You sure can toke and get life insurance ... . kinda ... Do n''t take all
        our answers as a 100 % YES that you can ... . Since the time of the last posts
        , a LOT has happened politically around the subject of weed . Some life insurance
        carriers have lightened up on their guidelines as well . If you like a little
        bud from time to time , HERE ARE THE TIPS I have wen looking for life insurance
        : 1 -RRB- BE UPFRONT . You ''re going to have to pee in a cup and donate a
        little blood . So do n''t lie . Tell the agent you smoke !! 2 -RRB- Be honest
        about how much & how often . How much and how often is very important when
        picking the right carrier . If you have any more questions , reach out !!

      - How much supplemental life insurance do you need ? Going to depend on what
        your desires are towards protecting your family in case of your early death
        . So the answer really is how much do you feel you need ? The question I have
        would be if you are healthy , why would you go with a supplemental plan when
        you could qualify for a personal plan that you own and control ? Supplimental
        life is a great deal if you are of questionable health . Usually there are
        few questions and minimal underwriting , which means the product has been
        priced assuming poor health to begin with . Remember more questions means
        lower price . Fewer questions mean they priced the insurance as if you already
        answered `` yes '' to the question .

      - Here is where the rubber meets the road . A high quality life insurer will
        handle the vast majority of claims within a 7 day period . Submit all the
        information needed and a check should be presented by the end of a week .
        If there are any questions , or any delays in giving the information to the
        insurance company , expect a few days more . Ultimately , your choice in picking
        insurance companies is a direct reflection on how long your family will have
        to wait to see their money -LRB- if ever -RRB- . Thank you . GARY LANE .
      - State life insurance commissioners monitor companies to ensure that life insurance
        proceeds are paid out in a timely manner . The beneficiary should receive
        the life insurance death benefit within two months of submitting the completed
        death claim and the insured person 's official death certificate to the life
        insurance company .
      - When an insured dies , the beneficiary making the claim on the policy will
        need to send in a completed claim form and a copy of the death certificate
        -LRB- some carriers may have an additional form - varies by carrier -RRB-
        . Once these items are received by the carrier , they will pay out the claim
        to the beneficiary . So , in short , it just depends on how long it takes
        the beneficiary to make the claim and send in the necessary paperwork . From
        there , I would expect it to take the carrier a couple of weeks for them to
        process everything and send the proceeds to the beneficiary .
      - It really depends on the customer service level and procedures of the your
        particular life insurance company . Regardless it is fairly quick . All carriers
        will require a certified copy of the death certificate and usually a short
        form , one or two pages , with some details . Most all life insurance companies
        will pay their death claims in a very timely manner once this documentation
        is in place .
      - 'I ''ll start out by saying that the best life insurance is the life insurance
        that is the right amount for your needs and is affordable to you . For the
        most part , it does n''t matter whether it ''s whole life , term life , or
        some combination of the two . Whole life is good for a number of reasons :
        It ''s the best way to cover a permanent need - The dividends and cash value
        build over time and , over a long period of time , the cash value may be more
        than the premiums you ''ve paid essentially making it free or better . Premiums
        are level - the premium you pay when you first get your whole life will be
        the same for your lifetime . It wo n''t increase and , as long as you pay
        that premium , you ''ll always have the policy . It ''s flexible - the cash
        value in your policy is yours and you can do with it what you ''d like . You
        can take a loan of your cash value or take part of it out if you need to .
        But , be aware this may affect your future premiums or the death benefit .
        The cash value grows tax deferred - You do n''t get a 1099 for the gain in
        your policy . You only pay income tax on the gain when you make a withdrawal
        . The gain in the cash value comes out last - When you make a withdrawal from
        your policy , your paid premiums come out first and , since you already paid
        tax on that money -LRB- usually -RRB- , you do n''t owe any income tax until
        you ''ve withdrawn all your premiums . A couple of qualifiers . My statements
        apply to the usual scenarios where you pay your premiums from your net income
        . If there is an arrangement where the premiums are deducted from your income
        tax , all withdrawals may be taxable . Also , the death benefit may become
        taxable to the beneficiary . These are higher level arrangements that would
        take a lot longer to explain . Bottom line , whole life insurance is good
        because it does things that no other life insurance program can . Used for
        the correct situation , it ''s the best at what it does . Find a good agent
        that will take the time to evaluate what you need and build a program that
        covers what you need at a price you can afford . The best life insurance is
        the insurance you have in force . If you ca n''t afford it and let it lapse
        , it does n''t do anything . Trust your agent and listen to their advice .'
      - The cost of life insurance can range from a few dollars per month to many
        thousands per month . The real question is how much would it cost you to get
        the proper policy for your situation . In order to find that out you need
        to first determine how much death benefit you need . The best way to calculate
        how much life insurance you need is by doing a comprehensive needs analysis
        . If you are looking for a quick rule-of-thumb , we recommend you carry at
        least ten times your annual income in life insurance . The second factor is
        how long do you think you will need the coverage . You might want life insurance
        to cover your mortgage which will be paid off in a certain period of time
        , or you might want life insurance just until your children are grown and
        self supporting . Maybe you want to have life insurance for whenever you die
        , be it next year or when you 're 90 . The third key factor is your budget
        . You might like the idea of a large permanent life insurance policy , but
        the premium may simply be more than you can reasonably afford . So in order
        to determine how much life insurance costs per month , you need to figure
        out how much life insurance you need , how long you need it and what your
        budget allows . By going through this process you can determine how much the
        proper life insurance policy for you will cost .
      - 'Video Transcript : Today ''s question is , How long does it take to get life
        insurance money ? Well I ''m assuming this question is how long does it take
        to get death benefit proceeds if somebody died that I am the beneficiary of
        ? If I ''m looking at that , usually it ''s around 30 to 60 days . You ''re
        going to get a form from the company . You ''re going to have to fill that
        form out . Generally they ''re going to get a newspaper clipping from the
        obituary and the certificate of death . Once that ''s processed , you should
        be getting a check , sometimes even wired to your account depending on how
        you set it up , you should be getting a check between 30 and 60 days generally
        , unless the death occurs in the first to years . If it ''s during the first
        two years of a contestability it ''ll take longer because the company has
        the right to investigate the claim .'
      - 'This varies for each person . A lot of variables go into the calculation
        of determining how much life insurance you need , how long you need it , and
        what is an appropriate amount to actually secure . A life insurance calculator

      - 'Yes , long-term care insurance policies cover the costs of being in an authorized
        nursing home up to the policy limits -LRB- maximum daily , or maximum monthly
        dollars -RRB- indicated in the policy , plus any additional purchases of coverage
        , and any automatic benefit increases , if suchriders were purchased . Today
        ''s long-term care insurance policiesalso cover other types of long-term care
        , includingcare costsat home , in an adult day-care center , and in authorized
        residential -LRB- also known as assisted living -RRB- facilities . Some policies
        also allow for the payment ofroutine domestic care such as house cleaning
        . A policy that covers all of these potential care costs is called a `` comprehensive
        '''' long-term care policy . Very few facility-only or home care only policies
        are sold these days . Costs of care in a facility can be paid in one of two
        ways : 1 -RRB- the caregiver or policyownersets up automatic monthly payments
        directly to the facility from the insurance company with any additional charges
        above the maximum daily or monthly benefit of the policy being paid out-of-pocket
        , or 2 -RRB- the caregiveror policyowner receives aa check to pay for facility
        service charge after being billed by the facility and having paid that bill
        out-of-pocket . There are some policies that pay cash directly to the insured
        in the amount of the maximum monthly benefit regardless of costs incurred
        . This is called an `` indemnity policy '''' and there are very few carriers
        that offer this type of coverage any longer . If the insured lives beyond
        the extent of the pool of money provided by the insurance company , the insured
        must pay for care out-of-pocket to remain in the facility . If the person
        has purchased a `` partnership '''' plan of long-term care andexhausts the
        funds of thatpolicy , Medicaid -LRB- Medical in CA -RRB- willtake over payments
        of care as long as the amount paid out by the policy is greater than thethe
        non-excludableassets of the insured .'
      - 'Short answer : About 8 % Long answer : It ''s hard to say exactly how many
        people own some type of policy that covers paying the costs of long term care
        - should one qualify for it - because there are many types of insurance policies
        that are not just `` stand-alone '''' long-term care policies , but plans
        of insurance that include being able to use a percentage of other plan benefits
        for paying long-term care costs :1 . Stand-alone long-term care insurance
        covers only long-term care costs . It has no cash value . When a policy owner
        dies , coverage either lapses or stops paying benefits . It is not transferable
        . It can not be bought or sold on a secondary market . This type of long-term
        care insurance is sometimes referred to as `` traditional '''' long-term care
        insurance , as well . It is the type of coverage that is most often associated
        with the `` percentage of Americans that own their own long-term care insurance
        '''' .2 . Hybrid long-term care contracts consist of having long-term coverage
        and a life insurance policy that guarantees to at least return the full premium
        paid into the policy to the insured ''s designated beneficiary . Usually ,
        these are single-premium contracts , but some have options to also pay over
        a specified period of time , such as 5 - or 10-years .3 . Linked life + long-term
        care policies are basically a traditional permanent life insurance contract
        -LRB- Whole Life or Universal Life , including the Variable or Indexed type
        -RRB- . If a person qualifies for long-term care and they have the long-term
        care rider on their life policy , they may apply to the insurance company
        to advance or accelerate the face value of the policy -LRB- death benefit
        -RRB- to pay for the costs of care . There are various limitations on how
        much can be advanced at a time . If the face value of the life contract is
        completely advanced for long-term care , there is usually a residual death
        benefit of $ 5,000 - $ 10,000.4 . The latest addition to life insurance product
        lines are policies offering `` living benefits '''' , one of which is very
        similar to the linked-life policy . In fact , the only difference is that
        a medical professional has to state in writing that the insured is not likely
        to recover from the condition that qualifies for long-term care benefits .
        -LRB- True long-term care insurance does not require that . -RRB- This type
        of living benefit is most often referred to as `` chronic care '''' or ``
        extended care '''' . Annuities may also have special considerations for paying
        out portions of the account value for long-term care costs.The point is ,
        people who own life insurance or annuity contracts with long-term care accommodations
        are not typically included in with the 8 % that own traditional long-term
        care . So , the real percentage of those that have made some type of insurance
        purchase to offset long-term care costs is greater than 8 % . I doubt , however
        , that the total percentage of Americans that own any of the above-described
        types of policies would exceed 20 % at this time .'
      - The exclusion ratio usually refers to taxation of the payments or proceeds
        . What they do is take what you paid in , divided by what you are paid out
        . This will come up with a percentage ratio . This ratio will be applied to
        the funds paid to you and that portion of the funds would be ` excluded '
        from taxation . Consult with a tax professional to see how this may apply
        to your individual situation .
      - Corporate owned life insurance -LRB- COLI -RRB- has been used for many years
        , but it 's purpose has fluctuated over the years . It began , and mainly
        is now , as a way to provide necessary funding to a business when a key employee
        died . The death benefit allows the employer to recoup some of the loss of
        earnings incurred when a productive employee dies , and provides funds for
        recruiting and training a replacement . For some years , it was a popular
        practice for an employer to take out life insurance on all employees . Because
        it covered even the most low paying jobs , this type of insurance was dubbed
        the nickname , `` dead peasant 's life insurance '' . However , tax advantages
        have been tightened up on COLI , and now employees must give their consent
        for their employer to take out this type of policy on them . So taking out
        life insurance on all employees is not as popular as it used to be . The answer
        to your question is , yes , your employer can take out life insurance on you
        , IF you give your consent .
      - Pure Term Life insurance has premiums that increase every year as you get
        older . Most people do n't like a premium that goes up every year so they
        decide how long they need the insurance and level out the premiums by buying
        level premium term . When you do this you are paying extra in the earlier
        years in order to level out the premium in the later years of your level premium
        period . That is why 1-year term is much cheaper than 20-year term . When
        you buy term life insurance , you should determine how long you want the premium
        to be level and buy it for that length . For instance if your mortgage is
        paid off in 18-more years , you should buy a 20-year level term policy if
        the mortgage payoff is the reason for the insurance .
      - 'Some questions to ask about long term care insurance are : 1 -RRB- Is there
        an inflation rider to cover increasing health care costs ? 2 -RRB- How long
        is the benefit period ? Does it go by years , or when the lump sum runs out
        ? 3 -RRB- How long is the elimination period ? 4 -RRB- What are the triggers
        for benefit to begin ? 5 -RRB- What type of care is covered ? -LRB- e.g. could
        you pay a relative to care for you in your home -RRB- 6 -RRB- Is the company
        solid ? What is their history of rate increases ? 7 -RRB- Is the policy tax
        qualified or a partnership policy ?'
      - Long Term Care Insurance is recommended for those having considerable assets
        . If you needed to go to a nursing home or assisted living facility , or receive
        home health care to assist you with your activities of daily living -LRB-
        dressing , eating , bathing , etc -RRB- , those institutions can go after
        your savings and investments while you are alive -LRB- if your spouse is alive
        , he/she can keep half -RRB- , and even take the proceeds from your home after
        you and your spouse die . If you have very little in the way of assets , long
        term care insurance is an unnecessary expense . But if you have assets you
        would like to protect , and can afford the premium , having long term care
        insurance is an excellent tool in planning your future , preserving your peace
        of mind , and paying the bills if needed . And a word about life insurance
        policies with living benefits . I am all in favor of them , but you do need
        to consider how much is `` enough '' when purchasing life insurance that you
        may want to use if you can no longer care for yourself . Nursing home costs
        average nearly $ 80,000 per year , nationally , for a semi-private room .
        Someone wanting to hire a round the clock caregiver in their home can expect
        to pay over $ 175,000 per year -LRB- $ 20 per hour -RRB- . It can be expensive
        to buy a permanent life insurance policy with face amounts large enough to
        cover even a couple years of care . Just be sure you understand how much of
        the life insurance face amount is available to you , what triggers it takes
        to get it , and when you can get it . Then compare it to the price of buying
        long term care insurance providing comparable benefits .
      - Part or all of Long Term Care Insurance premiums may be paid pre-tax if paid
        through an HSA -LRB- Health Savings Account -RRB- or Medicare medical savings
        account . The Long Term Care policy must be a qualified plan , and there is
        a limit based on age that determines how much can be paid from the HSA .
      - 'In a word , yes . But , it ''s more complicated than that . There are three
        different types of DI insurance and each has its on tax-treatment strategies
        .1 . Individual disability insurance -LRB- IDI -RRB- - This is what most people
        are referring to when they use the term `` DI '''' . It replaces a percentage
        of income . It comes in two flavors : long-term and short-term . If the premium
        is deducted as a health insurance medical expense on a schedule C , the income
        replacement benefit - should one become disabled - may be taxable as regular
        income . If it is `` paid-out-of-pocket '''' , the income replaced when disabled
        is not income taxable . The choice should be referred to a qualified tax advisor
        as insurance agents are not authorized to advise on tax issues . However ,
        I do n''t know a CPA that would recommend deducting premiums as a health insurance
        business expense . If one becomes disabled , they are going to want their
        benefit checks to be free from income taxes .2 . Business Overhead Expense
        -LRB- BOE , or simply OE -RRB- - If a business owner or partner becomes disabled
        , this type of insurance pays for a percentage of fixed business expenses
        . In my experience , tax advisors will direct that the premiums for this coverage
        be deducted as a business expense because while that makes the benefits income-taxable
        , the benefits will immediately pay for business expenses which are deductible
        . So , it ''s a bit of a wash , so to speak .3 . Buy-out disability insurance
        - This type of DI is most commonly purchased to sever a business relationship
        of an owner or partner that becomes totally disabled and thereby be a drain
        on the business without being able to actively produce or grow the company
        . The amount paid out is a lump sum which can be based on percentage of ownership
        -LRB- or stock -RRB- and theoretically be placed into a fund that would produce
        a continuing income to the bought-out owner or partner . Typically , the business
        owns this policy and pays premium on it . The tax treatment of the premium
        and payout depends on how the Articles of Incorporation are written or what
        kind of buy-sell agreement is in place . Both the company attorney and tax
        advisor need to be in on how the contract is titled and who pays premium at
        the time of application.It is imperative for the consumer of DI insurance
        to consult with qualified legal and tax advisors if there is any question
        at all about how the payment of premiums will be treated and/or the benefits
        used . The agent may offer an opinion , but it should not be accepted as legal
        or tax advice .'
      - 'A better question would be `` Who Should n''t Buy Long-term Care Insurance
        '''' ? Thats simpler to answer . The following people should NOT buy long
        term care insurance : 1 . Those that can not afford the premium on even a
        base policy . 2 . Those that have virtually no assets to pass on to the next
        generationand will need every available dollar saved for retirement . 3 .
        Those that will have to work until they die for lack of savings and insufficient
        Social Security payments or private pension . 4 . Those that can not medically
        qualify . 5 . Those that are already unable to perform regular daily activities
        of living without assistance . People in those conditions may qualify for
        the payment of long-term care through Medicaid -LRB- MediCal in California
        -RRB- if they come to a point in their life where they need care and ca n''t
        afford it . If the above conditions describe you in any way , you should be
        sitting down with your adult children or closest relatives and coming up with
        a plan of action should you be unable to take care of yourself . Everyone
        else should consider buying some long-term care insurance through an agent
        or agency that either specializes or has a specialist that is experienced
        in handling long-term care insurance casework . Having some amount of insurance
        is better than having none . When one qualifies to receive payments from the
        insurance company for long-term care , they are usually near the end of their
        life . The average long-term care claim is approximately 2 - 2.5 years . For
        those that need care longer than that , virtually all but the most unusual
        claims are paid out after 5 years . Families with a history of late-life mental
        illness -LRB- dementia or Alzheimers -RRB- should consider buying a larger
        pool of money than others , if they can afford it . It is in the best interest
        of the adult children to help out with long-term care premium payments if
        the elderly parents can not afford to pay all of the costs . Long-term care
        is an emotional , psychological , sociological , and family problem as much
        as it is financial . For the dignity of those who need care and the people
        or person most likely to be the caregiver , there needs to be a plan of action
        determined and long-term care insurance should be a part of that plan if it
        can be afforded and the person is medically qualified . Long-term care insurance
        is best purchased when young . Premiums can and will go up during the life
        of the policy if all the bells and whistles are included in the design of
        the coverage . But , those increases will seem like pocket-change if one needs
        long-term care . $ 80,000 per year is not unusual for facility care today
        . 24/7 home care can exceed $ 20,000 per month ! With family help , home care
        costs can be kept down . But , if facility care is required , there ''s not
        much that can be done about avoiding high costs . Long-term care costs vary
        by place . The left - and right-hand coasts are the most expensive . Relocation
        may be necessary to get affordable care in a quality facility .'
      - Statistically , nearly everyone will at some point need some type of care
        in their lifetime . As we get older our health declines . We are unable to
        do things for ourselves . The cost can be tremendous . Nursing Home average
        cost is between $ 6000 and $ 7000 . Cost for Assisted Living runs around $
        4000 . Home Health Care runs between $ 15 and $ 20 per hour . Medicare is
        very limited on what they will pay and does not pay for custodial care . The
        options , the family can try to care for the loved one . While many families
        try to take care of their loved one at home , the burden can be great , especially
        if the family has children in addition to caring for a loved one . Very often
        the situation is so bad it becomes nearly impossible without help . You can
        private pay for help either at home or a care facility , but it does n't take
        a mathematician to figure out that any assets would be rapidly depleted leading
        to the final option , go on Medicaid . Long Term Care provides funds to pay
        for care without having to lose everything you have worked hard to provide
        and the legacy you wanted to leave behind for your children and grandchildren
        . It relieves the burden and embarassment of having our personal needs taken
        care of by family members . Anyone who has ever been a caregiver knows how
        hard it can be . Why buy Long Term Care Insurance ? Because you love your
        family !
      - 'Whole Life -LRB- AKA , Ordinary Life -RRB- is more expensive because the
        insurance company is accepting a higher risk to provide the guarantees of
        contract . There are primarily two types of whole life contracts that guarantee
        both the face amount -LRB- death benefit -RRB- to the beneficiary and the
        internal tax-favored build up of cash values . Participating whole life offers
        the insured the opportunity to `` participate '''' in the financial success
        of the underwriting carrier by providing the possibility of receiving a dividend
        at the end of each policy year . Dividends are not guaranteed and while they
        are presented as a percent -LRB- example : 5.2 % credited dividend rate -RRB-
        , they are not the same as simple interest . It involves a formula that takes
        into account the cash values in the in force policy along with the investment
        returns and claims experience of the insurance company in any given year .
        The policy owner can direct the company to use the dividend in any one of
        four to six ways , depending on the carrier . All but one of those options
        will not produce an incometax event . -LRB- Taking the dividend as cash ,
        however , will . -RRB- Most whole life policyowners either choose to have
        the dividend purchase paid up additions of insurance -LRB- increasing the
        death benefit as well as the cash value of the policy -RRB- or to reduce premium
        with excess to purchase paid up additions . Non-participating whole life or
        interest-sensitive whole life does not pay a dividend . But , it most likely
        does provide some level of a guaranteed death benefit and guaranteed cash
        values . Some whole life policies now provide the opportunity to over-pay
        the guaranteed level premium for a period of time to turbo-charge the growth
        of the cash value which grows tax-deferred . This requires the addition of
        a paid-up additions rider -LRB- PUAR -RRB- and there are limitations on how
        much over-payment one can make . This capability has been touted by some financial
        planners as a way of being your own bank because access to and repayment of
        cash value loans are tax-favored . One avoids a lengthy wait for approval
        that a bank would need to approve a loan , as well . -LRB- Go to Amazon.com
        and search `` be your own bank '''' for more details . -RRB- In the current
        unstable economic environment we are in , whole life hasexperienced a comeback
        in sales due to the safety and security of this type of insurance contract
        with tax-deferred inside build up of cash values producing rates of return
        higher than other fixed interest financial vehicles . However , some analysts
        minimizethose perceived advantages because historically market returns exceed
        cash value build up , and there can be dire consequences to the policy if
        cash values are not managed prudently . Reckless use of taking loans can result
        in the death benefit being greatly reduced or cause the policy to lapse with
        little or no value . Whole life is not suitable in all circumstances calling
        for the application of a life insurance policy . Those seeking direction and
        guidance should consult with an experienced insurance professional or knowledgeable
        Certified Financial Planner or other advising professional before purchasing
        any life insurance contract .'
      labels:
      - Here is where the rubber meets the road . A high quality life insurer will
        handle the vast majority of claims within a 7 day period . Submit all the
        information needed and a check should be presented by the end of a week .
        If there are any questions , or any delays in giving the information to the
        insurance company , expect a few days more . Ultimately , your choice in picking
        insurance companies is a direct reflection on how long your family will have
        to wait to see their money -LRB- if ever -RRB- . Thank you . GARY LANE .
      - State life insurance commissioners monitor companies to ensure that life insurance
        proceeds are paid out in a timely manner . The beneficiary should receive
        the life insurance death benefit within two months of submitting the completed
        death claim and the insured person 's official death certificate to the life
        insurance company .
      - When an insured dies , the beneficiary making the claim on the policy will
        need to send in a completed claim form and a copy of the death certificate
        -LRB- some carriers may have an additional form - varies by carrier -RRB-
        . Once these items are received by the carrier , they will pay out the claim
        to the beneficiary . So , in short , it just depends on how long it takes
        the beneficiary to make the claim and send in the necessary paperwork . From
        there , I would expect it to take the carrier a couple of weeks for them to
        process everything and send the proceeds to the beneficiary .
      - It really depends on the customer service level and procedures of the your
        particular life insurance company . Regardless it is fairly quick . All carriers
        will require a certified copy of the death certificate and usually a short
        form , one or two pages , with some details . Most all life insurance companies
        will pay their death claims in a very timely manner once this documentation
        is in place .

      - That is a great question ! If the camera equipment was damaged or stolen from
        your apartment , it should be covered . Was it specialized equipment ? If
        so , you hopefully had kept model and serial numbers , and had it mentioned
        under your coverage . Contact your agent to be certain , but you should be
        fine . Thanks for asking !
      - Yes , they usually do , but talk to your Insurance Professional because many
        companies will only cover unscheduled camera equipment up to a certain limit
        and subject to your policy deductible . In order to be sure that you have
        the proper amount of coverage that you need for items like this , it is best
        to consider insuring it `` specifically '' on either a rider to your Renters
        Policy or as a stand-alone contract . This way , your coverage will be based
        upon the retail value or appraised value of your equipment , which would also
        be identified by make and model which would make replacement much easier if
        you suffered a covered loss . Also , in most cases , this coverage is offered
        with out a deductible as an option meaning that you have in effect dollar
        1 protection .

      - Yes , there is coverage under the comprehensive portion of your auto policy
        . In order to receive payment the amount lost must exceed the deductible and
        it must be the result of damage to the car . After market items such as radar
        detectors are not always covered depending on how they are installed . Personal
        property located in the car is covered by your homeowners policy , again subject
        to the deductible . Professional equipment or business property is normally
        not covered . If you are a part time photographer and advertise on the internet
        dont turn in a claim for a room full of camera equipment stolen from your
        Honda Fit .

      - Talk to your Insurance professional , but in most cases , modern Renters Insurance
        Policies do include theft as a covered peril , yes . Now , there may be policy
        limits included that you need to know about . In some cases , companies can
        settle covered theft losses on certain things , like camera equipment for
        example , based upon a stated `` inside limit '' listed on your policy 's
        declaration sheet . Further , your personal property may be covered outside
        your home -LRB- while on vacation or in your car as two examples -RRB- but
        only up to a stated maximum of 10 % of the total Personal Property coverage
        amount .
      - Talk to your insurance Professional about the coverage provided by your policy
        , but in general , personal property outside your home is usually covered
        , including while travelling . Now , most policies will cover your belongings
        up to a certain total percentage of your current Personal Property stated
        amount . So , for example , if you have $ 50,000 stated coverage in your policy
        , you may have coverage up to 10 % while travelling . Likewise there may be
        certain `` inside limits '' for categories of property such as camera equipment
        that may further limit the amount of coverage that you actually have .
      - The Declaration Page of your policy outlines your specific coverage for the
        policy as issued by your insurance company . The `` Dec Page '' will show
        the effective date that the policy period began as well as it 's expiration
        date which is usually 1 year later . It will list your mortgage company and
        will also include your name and mailing address as well as the property address
        if different . It will then list the specific coverage for you dwelling ,
        personal property , additional structures and Liability as well as the property
        deductible . If there are any it will list any inside limits to certain categories
        of personal property like jewelry , camera equipment etc. . Finally it will
        list the distance you are to a fire hydrant and/or fire station and the Fire
        rating classification as well as your annual premium . Your complete policy
        consists of the declaration , the Policy Jacket which outlines the broad language
        coverage that the policy provides as well as it limitations and exclusions
        , and any applicable endorsements .
      - Typically , Yes . Renters insurance coverage is nothing more than coverage
        for YOUR personal items . So if you are in a rental apartment with 3 other
        people , you would each want to get your own policy to cover your specific
        items . But be careful . Renters policies will have limits on certain items
        like , cameras , musical instruments etc. . So although you can have $ 10,000
        in coverage , but have a $ 3,000 guitar , you might not be fully covered .
        -LRB- depending on the policy limit -RRB- . Be sure to ask your agent specific
        questions to make sure
      - 'I am not quite sure what your asking , so I will answer this question , which
        is what I think you asked : `` What are the standard coverages included in
        a renters policy ? '''' The standard coverage in a renters policy includes
        personal property , liability and medical payments . Personal property can
        be general property and scheduled property -LRB- i.e. jewelry , cameras ,
        hearing aids -RRB- on premise ; and , sometimes , there can be a sub-limit
        for personal property off-premise . Liability covers your negligent acts against
        a third party . Medical payments provides a small sum of money to people who
        hurt themselves at your rented premise . I hope this answers what you were
        asking .'
      - Medicare Part A , in short , is your hospital insurance - Part B is your physician
        insurance . Part A provides benefits for your inpatient hospital stay , skilled
        nursing facility care , nursing home care , hospice care , and certain home
        health services . The benefit that is the most common claim is for hospital
        stays . During a hospital stay , your Part A will cover certain hospital services
        and supplies including semi-private rooms , meals , general nursing , and
        medications given during your stay . Acceptable hospital stays can include
        critical access hospitals , inpatient rehab facilities , LTC hospitals , acute
        care hospitals , and mental health care - you may want to confirm with Medicare
        whether a certain inpatient stay would be covered by a facility that is not
        a traditional hospital . Part B covers doctor visits , tests , surgeries ,
        preventive services , and supplies including DMEs -LRB- durable medical equipment
        -RRB- . You 're generally responsible for a deductible -LRB- $ 1,216 for Part
        A and $ 147 for Part B -RRB- and about 20 % of the healthcare expenses that
        are incurred during these visits - Medicare only covers approximately 80 %
        of the costs . You may want to consider buying a Medicare supplement plan

      - Medicare Part A is called Hospital Insurance . With some exceptions , it covers
        inpatient services at hospitals , skilled nursing facilities and rehab facilities
        , as well as home health and hospice services . Medicare Part B is called
        Medical Insurance . Again , with some exceptions , it covers doctor 's services
        , durable medical equipment , hospital outpatient services , labs , mental
        health care , some preventative care , and some home health and ambulance
        services . All the services must be medically necessary and must be approved
        by Medicare to be covered .
      - Medicare is a federal-government run program so the type of coverage available
        under Medicare Parts A & B -LRB- also known as Original Medicare -RRB- will
        be the same regardless of the state you live in . The calculation of premiums
        for Original Medicare is the same everywhere as well - your income level can
        increase your Part B monthly premium though as it 's based on income level
        brackets . Medicare Part A is your hospital insurance . It provides benefits
        for your inpatient hospital stay , skilled nursing facility care , nursing
        home care , hospice care , and certain home health services . The benefit
        that is the most common claim is for hospital stays . During a hospital stay
        , your Part A will cover certain hospital services and supplies including
        semi-private rooms , meals , general nursing , and medications given during
        your stay . Acceptable hospital stays can include critical access hospitals
        , inpatient rehab facilities , LTC hospitals , acute care hospitals , and
        mental health care - you may want to confirm with Medicare whether a certain
        inpatient stay would be covered by a facility that is not a traditional hospital
        . Medicare Part B is your physician insurance . It covers doctor visits ,
        tests , surgeries , preventive services , and supplies including DMEs -LRB-
        durable medical equipment -RRB- . The Part B deductible is $ 147 in 2014 .
        You 're responsible for about 20 % of healthcare expenses covered by Part
        B - Medicare only covers approximately 80 % of the costs . There is a guidebook
        called `` Medicare & You '' that provides a lot of information regarding Medicare
        coverage - the guidebook is updated each year with any new changes to coverage
        - you can get a copy of this from the medicare.gov website as well as look
        up additional information . I always recommend those on Medicare buy a Medigap
        plan to supplement their Part A & Part B coverage . Your Part A & Part B only
        covers about 80 % of expenses . A Medigap plan can cover all or a portion
        of the other 20 % of the expenses . The big advantage of having a Medigap
        plan is that it creates a very predictable healthcare expense structure .
        Medigap plans are also standardized , meaning the plan benefits are the same
        regardless of which company you purchase it from . The premiums for these
        programs can vary from company to company . I hope the information is helpful
        - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions
        . Thanks very much .

      - In a very general nutshell , Medicare in Virginia covers hospitalization and
        skilled care in a nursing facility under Medicare Part A , doctor services
        and durable medical equipment under Medicare Part B , and prescription drugs
        under Medicare Part D. Part A and B cover more than stated , and Medicare
        Advantage Plans , or Medicare Part C , will cover some of the gaps . There
        are also other supplement plans that each have their own features that they
        offer in Medicare coverage .
      - Medicare part A which covers medical expenses resulting from hospital services
        is financed by payroll taxes on workers in employment covered by OASDI -LRB-
        Old-Age , Survivors , And Disability Insurance -RRB- on a pay as you go basis
        . Medicare part B which covers partial reimbursement for the cost of physician
        services , diagnostic tests , ambulance services , prosthetic devices , physical
        therapy , medical equipment , and home health services is funded primarily
        through the premiums of those enrolled and is not `` pay as you go '' .

      - That is a great question ! If the camera equipment was damaged or stolen from
        your apartment , it should be covered . Was it specialized equipment ? If
        so , you hopefully had kept model and serial numbers , and had it mentioned
        under your coverage . Contact your agent to be certain , but you should be
        fine . Thanks for asking !
      - Yes , they usually do , but talk to your Insurance Professional because many
        companies will only cover unscheduled camera equipment up to a certain limit
        and subject to your policy deductible . In order to be sure that you have
        the proper amount of coverage that you need for items like this , it is best
        to consider insuring it `` specifically '' on either a rider to your Renters
        Policy or as a stand-alone contract . This way , your coverage will be based
        upon the retail value or appraised value of your equipment , which would also
        be identified by make and model which would make replacement much easier if
        you suffered a covered loss . Also , in most cases , this coverage is offered
        with out a deductible as an option meaning that you have in effect dollar
        1 protection .

      - You can purchase a short term disability policy in only a few places . Your
        employer may offer it to you to buy as a voluntary group policy , or you can
        purchase it as an individual policy . Contact a Disability Insurance broker
        to find out which companies sell it and to apply for coverage .
      - Yes , disability insurance is really paycheck insurance and protects your
        income stream in the event an accident or illness prevents you from working
        . There are two type of disability insurance ; Short Term & Long Term disability
        . Short term plans usually cover periods of 13 or 26 weeks . Long Term plans
        , as their name implies , run for longer terms that can go on for years depending
        upon the policy . It is estimated that a 20 year old has a 25 % chance of
        being disabled for some period of time before they reach retirement age .
        Currently 12 % of the U.S. population is disabled with only 5 % of those disabilities
        being work related . So , a health problem or off the job accident is the
        most likely cause of someone becoming disabled . A recent report shows the
        average Social Security Disability payment is $ 1065 per month and qualifying
        for Social Security disability is famous for being difficult and time consuming
        with waits of 2 years for approval not being uncommon and as of 2009 , only
        30 % of Social Security disability claims were approved . Relying on Social
        Security alone to preserve your lifestyle in the event of a disability is
        unwise . The majority of persons who experience a disabling event can return
        to work within about 90-days . But , for persons who experience a disability
        exceeding 90-days the average length of these types of disabling events is
        3.2 years ! Ideally , a person will have both short term and long term disability
        insurance protection . Short term disability insurance will be less expensive
        and if your budget does n't allow for both coverages I would suggest starting
        out with short term coverage for the longest coverage period possible . If
        you are a female I would also recommend that you verify how a prospective
        short term disability policy treats maternity . Some policies treat maternity
        as a disabling event while others do not . This can be an important difference
        for a woman in her child bearing years .
      - I presume that you have purchased a long term disability policy as this is
        the logical precursor to being able to file a disability claim . Assuming
        this to be the case , then you or a friend or family member should contact
        your insurance agent or the insurance company you purchased your disability
        policy through and inform them that you have had a disabling event and need
        to file a claim . If your disability policy is provided by your employer you
        may want to contact your human resources department to start the claims process
        . In either event , you will be sent a claim form to complete and return to
        the insurance carrier . You should expect that the insurance carrier will
        request medical documentation of your claim of disability and perhaps the
        circumstances surrounding the cause of your disability . If you were charging
        people to watch you attempt to jump over the Grand Canyon in your Mini Cooper
        you may find that your disability claim will be denied due to an exclusion
        in your policy . Depending upon the how your disability policy was structured
        there will quite likely be an elimination or waiting period before your disability
        payments will begin . This period will vary depending upon the waiting period
        you selected when purchasing your policy . A 90-day waiting period is quite
        common but it could be 6-months or even a year . This is why some people purchase
        both Short Term and Long Term Disability policies . A Short Term Disability
        policy that kicks in on day one of an accident or after a week of an illness
        and that runs for 90-days or 6-months combined with a Long Term Disability
        policy with a 90-day or 6-month waiting period can often be less expensive
        and trying to purchase a Long Term Disability policy with a very short waiting
        period .
      - Short term disability insurance is paycheck protection in case of a disability
        event . And many consumers can only afford short term disability versus long
        term disability coverage . Mutual of Omaha is a major carrier in short term
        disability insurance . Keep in mind that you may have short term disability
        insurance through your employers group benefit plan . You also have Social
        Security disability insurance , although benefits may be limited .
      - Short Term disability Insurance pays a percentage of your salary if you become
        temporarily disabled , meaning that you are not able to work for a short period
        of time due to a sickness or injury -LRB- excluding on-the-job-injuries ,
        which are covered by workers compensation insurance -RRB- . A typical short-term
        disability insurance policy provides you with 40 to 65 percent of your pre-disability
        base salary , according to the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education
        . The National Association of Insurance Commissioners estimates that these
        benefits generally last between three to six months . Most short-term disability
        insurance policies have a `` cap '' , meaning you receive a maximum benefit
        amount per month . Short-term disability insurance policies also have a limit
        on the amount of times that you can receive benefits-up to two years , according
        to the Insurance Information Institute . .
      - There is a huge inventory of disability insurance companies that carry short
        term disability and some short term disability group plans for business .
        Before purchasing short term disability insurance , make sure your employer
        does n't offer it . Here are a few on short term disability companies that
        come to mind Mutual of Omaha , Aflac , Lincoln Financial Group .
      - Disability insurance is offered as short term disability , generally two years
        , and long term disability , generally to age 65 . The elimination or waiting
        period needs to be established on the basis of your cash reserves . And keep
        in mind that many employer sponsored group plans include short term disability
        coverage . Having short term disability coverage may allow you to purchase
        long term disability coverage with a longer elimination period .
      - Aflac offers short term disability insurance through employer sponsored plans
        , only . Aflac does not sell individual short term disability plans to individuals
        . Their short term disability plans must be paid for by worksite premium payroll
        deduction . There are only a couple of companies that offer individual short
        term disability insurance . Many more offer individual long term care disability
        insurance .
      - Short Term Disability is used to replace approx 40-70 % of your salary if
        disabled for a `` short '' period of time . Most short term disabilities last
        from 3-6 months , although the cap can be as high as two years . The coverage
        may kick in as soon as the disability is determined , or there may be a waiting
        period . If purchasing your own policy , the higher the premium you pay ,
        the shorter the waiting period . Some of the uses for short term disability
        are partial income replacement in case of pregnancy , muscle strains , broken
        bones , pneumonia , heart attack , or chemotherapy treatments .
      - You can get Short Term Disability insurance from agencies that sell Disability
        Insurance , and who carry Disability products from Assurity Life Insurance
        Company and Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company . These companies offer the
        purchase of private , Short Term Disability policies . Other than that , you
        could get Short Term Disability coverage from your place of work , if they
        offer it as a group benefit .
      - 'You need to check by state to confirm these disability insurance companies
        , but here are some of the more popular carriers : Mutual of Omaha is a major
        carrier in short term disability insurance . Keep in mind that you may have
        short term disability insurance through your employers group benefit plan
        . You also have Social Security disability insurance , although benefits may
        be limited .'
      - First understand there are two basic types of disability insurance . The first
        is a short term disability plan . These benefits are usually a fixed amount
        not to exceed 70 % of your current income and can start paying almost immediately
        . These short term plans can pay daily , weekly or monthly but for a shorter
        period of time usually a few months to up to one year . The second type of
        disability is long term disability plans . These benefits have a longer elimination
        period usually 30-60-90-180-360 days before benefits commence but will pay
        for years or up to age 67 years old . Most long term plans will pay up to
        70 % of your current income at time of claim .
      - Short term life insurance , such as 5 year Term or 10 year Term , can cost
        much less than life insurance locked in for longer periods of time , such
        as 30 year Term Life insurance or Universal Life . However , when that short
        term is complete , the price for that policy will jump extremely high . If
        the insured person 's health has gotten worse during that time , he/she may
        need to pay much higher premiums or possibly may not even qualify for a new
        life insurance policy . Therefore , it is important to look at the need involved
        , when purchasing a life insurance policy . If you are 40 years old and want
        it to cover your children going to college , getting a short term policy may
        suffice . If you want it to pay for your funeral , then it is better go with
        some type permanent plan .
      - 'Assuming you are healthy , working and generally younger than age 65 , yes
        you should be able to secure disability insurance coverage . But before you
        start shopping for short term disability insurance you may have it already
        in your employer group benefit plan , so talk to your human resource department
        to find out . If you decide to shop for short term disability insurance ,
        keep in mind that there are really only about a dozen disability companies
        worth reviewing . You can divide them into two categories : blue and white
        collar vocations . Once you identify your category the companies to review
        are few . We can help with that .'
      - Some employer sponsored group plans offer short term disability insurance
        . If your employer doesnt offer this , then you can purchase short or long
        term insurance , providing that you can qualify . Disability insurance costs
        are based on your health , your activities and your compensation . Personal
        information is part of the pricing process like your gender , age , health
        history , current medical condition , smoking status , etc. . Your activities
        like recreation , vocation , motor vehicle violations , etc. . Up to 60 %
        of your compensation can generally be protected with tax benefits . Up to
        80 % of your compensation , if you can legitimately deduct the premiums as
        a business expense , but then the benefits are taxable . You may pay 3 to
        5 % of your compensation for disability insurance .
      - Short-term Disability does work if you have a qualifying disability . When
        you are applying for short or long-term disability , you need to look at the
        definition of disability and occupation . Not all companies have the same
        definition . If the definition is vague , you may find yourself being denied
        on your claim or receiving a `` lesser '' amount then what you have applied
        for .
      - Yes , it is common for someone to have a short term disability policy and
        a separate long term disability policy . However , it may not make sense to
        have 2 short terms or 2 long terms . Disability insurance plans will coordinate
        benefits and will not pay over their maximum amounts , usually no more than
        70 % of one 's current income at time of claim .
      - Before you start shopping for short term disability insurance , find out if
        your employer sponsored group plan offers it . Many of these types of plans
        offer short term disability insurance as part of the overall employee benefits.But
        if you have to shop , start online with brokerage outlets that specialize
        or have complete departments dedicated to disability insurance . Most of these
        firms have access to a wide range of carriers that can spread sheet the players
        in disability insurance .
      - The probability of a disability sometime during your working life is statistically
        high . Most people cant afford to pay for full coverage , so short term disability
        is a triage solution that can take some of the cash flow pressure off your
        budget during periods of disability . Some employers actually have short term
        disability in their group benefit plans .
      - You should get Disability Insurance so that you can receive income if you
        were to become disabled . Short Term Disability pays income to the insured
        person when they suffer disabilities that last from a few weeks to a couple
        of years . Long Term Disability pays income to the insured person when disabled
        by conditions that last from a few months to permanent disability .

      - You can purchase a short term disability policy in only a few places . Your
