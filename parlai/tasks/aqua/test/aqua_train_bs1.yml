    text: In how many different ways can the letters of the word ' MATHEMATICS ' be
      arranged so that the vowels always come together ?

    - 'In the word '' MATHEMATICS '' we treat the two vowels AEAI as one letter .
      Thus , we have MTHMTCS ( AEAI )

      Now , we have to arranged 8 letters , out of which M occurs twice , T occurs
      twice and the rest are different .

      Number of ways of arranging these letters = 8 ! / ( 2 ! ) ( 2 ! ) = 10080 .

      Now AEAI has 4 letters in which A occurs 2 times and the rest are different
      .

      number of ways of arranging these letters = 4 ! / 2 ! = 12 .

      Required number of ways = ( 10080 * 12 ) = 120960 .

      Answer is A'
