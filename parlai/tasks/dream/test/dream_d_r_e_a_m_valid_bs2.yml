        so long though I do enjoy being a teacher. I''m considering trying something

        M: I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time.

        W: I have one ten-day tour that is still available. It will depart from New
        York on December 24.

        round-trip airfare.

        that, but I''ve never been to London.

        W: Oh, then you have flown before too.

        M: No, that was during the Second World War and I went to Europe on a large
        ship carrying soldiers.

        W: Things are quite different in Europe nowadays.

        M: Yes, I did. But I prefer a small company.

        M: Oh, yes. It''s much different. I like a small company because it''s more
        exciting.

        W: You mean a large company is boring to work for?

        M: No, it''s not boring. But a large company has too many people and because
        it is so big that two or three people couldn''t possibly make all the important
        decisions.

        W: You see, small businesses have a common problem: only the two or three
        people who run it can make decisions, and the employees may not be very happy
        because they can''t make decisions.

        M: But large companies also have a common problem, so many people are making
        decisions that sometimes it is a waste of time and money.

        W: Well, I guess there are problems everywhere.

        M: Yeah, but I still prefer working for a small company. It''s more interesting
        and I''ll keep more opportunities.
