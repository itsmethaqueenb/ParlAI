    text: 'M: When I got home last night I found a letter from the school I used to
      study in. The students there want me to go back and talk to them.

      W: Oh, really? And are you going?

      M: I don''t know. I used to hate school, so I don''t feel like going back.

      W: But it''s different now.

      M: Yes, I know. But it''s still a difficult situation. You see, when I was at
      school I used to be bad at studies and none of the teachers liked me.

      W: Well; I think you should go. When I was younger, I used to dream about meeting
      a famous pop star. You can''t let them down.

      M: Maybe you are right. OK, I''ll go.
