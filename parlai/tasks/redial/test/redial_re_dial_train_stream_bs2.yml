      - I haven't seen a good documentary in a LONG time.  I generally prefer historical
        or environmental docs, but I can look into others as well.
      text: I am great thanks. Excellent morning for a movie. Is there a particular
        genre you like?

      - Oh wait, I'm thinking The Cove  (which is a good one if you're into animal
        rights docs, but it's got a sad ending).  I haven't seen Blackfish , but I'd
        be down to give it a try.
      text: It is about the killer whale Tilikum who was at SeaWorld.

      - Is there any animation you can recommend? Not necessarily documentaries, mind
        you, lol.
      text: I haven't watched The Cove  . Blackfish  was surprisingly good...definitely
        eye opening.
